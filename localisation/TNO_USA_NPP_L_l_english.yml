#Gus "Shoot them Down" Hall#

#Leader Description
POLITICS_HALL_DESC:0 "Many words apply to Gus Hall, and "presidential" isn't likely to be one of them. Born Arvo Kustaa Halberg in Minnesota's great Iron Range, he grew up speaking Finnish with nine other siblings, in a frigid log cabin that his immigrant father built after having been driven from work for organizing with the International Workers of the World. Hall himself left school to work in logging camps at the age of 15, to support his family, and soon after joined the Young Communist League. That work with the YCL allowed him to travel to Bukharin's USSR, and Hall spent several years studying at the International Lenin School. Throughout the 1930s, Hall stared down police and bosses at strikes across Minnesota and Ohio, among steelworkers, farmers, and teamsters.\n\nAfter a stint in the Navy during the war against Japan, Hall then spent much of the 1950s being hounded by prosecutors for proposing the overthrow of the US government. He made himself known as a prominent member of the Communist Party of the USA, speaking on college campuses and debating conservatives on live TV. Despite this, Hall seemed doomed to become a marginal figure in American political life. However, the rise of the NPP's leftist faction has propelled him far beyond such margins. Now, after the unlikeliest political triumph in American history, President Hall is seeking to uplift America's marginalized, unite the working class, and create a new America, built for all instead of the few.\n\nMaybe he isn't presidential. But President Gus Hall is certainly aiming to be revolutionary."

WORLD.726.t:0 "Gus Hall Inaugurated as President of the United States"
WORLD.726.desc:0 "Today, Gus Hall took the oath of office to become the newest President of the United States. In front of a crowd of hundreds of thousands in Washington, President Hall declared: "America must fight for liberation at home from those who line their pockets with the blood of the working class."\n\nA longtime union organizer and member of the Communist Party of the USA, Hall has faced more than one stint in a prison cell for his activities. However, those controversies didn't prevent him from winning the presidency, in one of the greatest shocks in American political history. Already, anti-leftist protests are springing up across the country. President Hall seeks to unite America under the banner of working class liberation, but it's clear that his election has created a divide as vast as any in living memory."

USA.1706.t:0 "The Inauguration of President Hall"
USA.1706.d:0 "The crowd, in all their hundreds of thousands, looks like a fever dream. Labor stalwarts from the UAW have the uneasy grins of those caught up in events beyond belief. Elders, whose parents stared down militiamen at Lawrence, who were lifted up onto the shoulders of others to see Debs speak at Canton, who spent their lives writing and agitating in pursuit of a future they desperately hoped could someday be made real, are watching with glistening eyes. Long-haired students and proudly afroed activists who got their start fighting against the South Africa draft are gathered in circles, taking turns denouncing America and grudgingly congratulating the President-elect. Most of them never thought they would do anything but loathe the American electoral system. Most of them still do, but at the moment, that matters a bit less.\n\nA number of senators and congresspeople have boycotted the inauguration, but the crowd of notables behind President Hall's podium is still large. The Chief Justice administers the oath without enthusiasm, and the crowd roars.\n\n"My fellow Americans, citizens of the world... comrades."\n\nThe crowd roars harder, almost drowning out the new President. Through stump speeches, ballot boxes, door-to-door campaigning, and all the electoral institutions written down by wig-clad slavers, revolution, however tenuous, has come to America."
USA.1706.a:0 "Today, the world shakes once more."
