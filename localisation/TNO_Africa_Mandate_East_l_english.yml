 MZB_USA_eastern_african_developments_desc:0 "The aim of the temporary §BOFN Mandates§! in Africa is to serve as transition between German rule and local sovereignty.\n\nIf we manage to peacefully carry out our decolonization plans, we will be able to bring back §O80%§! of the resources we have generated here.\n\nIf we choose to prematurely decolonize, we will only be able to bring back §O40%§! of the resources we have generated here.\n\nIn the case of a complete collapse of the mandate, we will we will have to §Rabandon§! the resources we have generated here."

POLITICS_WILLIAM_WESTMORELAND_DESC:0 "Home to some of the fiercest fighting of the war, East Africa has been a constant thorn in the side of its leader since the establishment of the Reichskommissariat- first Hans Huttig, and now General Westmoreland. The East African mandate is hardly a state at all, hastily established as the Ostafrika SS collapsed during the American offensive. The unstable interim state must now contend with the rebels who managed to survive the brutal repression of the Huttig regime; the most hardened, brutal, and determined people on the continent.\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland, widely hailed in the American press for his triumph over the initial Schild offensive and later equally reviled for his controversial strategy of attrition, is the only man for the job. Making heavy use of the American advantage in bombers and artillery, Westmoreland met with great success on the battlefield and great opposition from the home front, and the brutal repression deemed necessary to keep East Africa under control has only made things worse.\n\nWith the last of the SS defeated or driven underground Westmoreland now finds himself in the unenviable position of trying to deescalate conflict on a battlefield won by escalation. Superior firepower means little now that the enemy can simply melt away into the jungle when faced with superior force. A man of war tasked with bringing peace, Westmoreland is in a race against time to defeat the insurgency and stabilize East Africa before the little goodwill left at home runs out."

This has given us a useful chemical industry in the few areas truly under our control, and the developments Hüttig made will assist the US military in their own research of this lethal science."

Most of these acts of resistance were cut short by an executioner's bullet, and only the most brutal and ruthless rebels have survived this long. Armed with a miscellany of stolen German and black market weapons, they have turned East Africa into a bloody pathwork of warlord states. We must act decisively to restore order from chaos."

This makes controlling anywhere more than a few miles from the coast an exercise in futility, at least until our own infrastructure projects make some headway where Hüttig failed."
