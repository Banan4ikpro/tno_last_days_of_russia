 ANG_USA_angolan_developments_desc:0 "The aim of the temporary §BOFN Mandates§! in Africa is to serve as transition between German rule and local sovereignty.\n\nIf we manage to peacefully carry out our decolonization plans, we will be able to bring back §O80%§! of the resources we have generated here.\n\nIf we choose to prematurely decolonize, we will only be able to bring back §O40%§! of the resources we have generated here.\n\nIn the case of a complete collapse of the mandate, we will we will have to §Rabandon§! the resources we have generated here."

POLITICS_JOHN_LAVELLE_DESC:0 "Most generals are used to having their orders obeyed without question. During his time in Angola, General John Lavelle has learned to expect the opposite. In some ways Lavelle has the easiest job of the three mandate leaders- there are less radicalized rebel warlords or predatory corporations to deal with, for one- but that ease of ruling also leads to greater expectations. America and Lavelle both see a real opportunity for the torch of freedom to shine brightly in Angola, and both wish to ignite that spark.\n\nHowever, what Congress sees from across the ocean and what Lavelle sees from Luanda are very different things. UNITA and the MPLA were cooperative and helpful in the American occupation, having secured their own territories against the Germans and each other. However, it is abundantly clear that their truce will last only as long as the American military presence, one which cannot remain for long. Facing down both Angolan factions and the overblown expectations of Congress, Lavelle will have to use all of his diplomatic skill to bring Angola to its full potential."

Airstrips and runways can be found all across the plains of Angola, many of them still functioning. These will serve as useful bases for our pacification of the continent, allowing us to bring in military supplies and personnel for the mandates, and someday, when the war's over, bring our boys home."

While both participated in the overthrow of Nazi tyranny, they also significantly hindered our operations by fighting with each other almost as much as they fought the Germans. General Lavelle has brokered an uneasy truce, but the situation will likely last only as long as the German insurgency still remains."
