 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_RURIK_II_DESC:0 "Major General Nikolay Ivanovich Krylov was once an officer of the Red Army, serving as Chief of Staff for the 62nd Army in battles like Sevastopol and Voroshilovgrad. But as the Great Patriotic War became nothing but great defeats for the Soviets, Krylov was wounded both inside and out, and the stress of constant retreats led to a nervous breakdown. However, the 62nd was unaffected by his affliction, since it had already disintegrated. He and his small band of officers without an army joined the eastward wave of refugees pouring over the Urals, eventually finding his superiors in the Central Siberian Republic. Sent by the Republic to deal with the Anarchist insurgency of the Siberian Black Army, Krylov suffered a humiliating defeat and later faced betrayal by one of his trusted subordinates, General Andreev in Krasnoyarsk, and was forced to retreat his forces in Kemerovo. There, he fell deeper into his stupor, drinking or smoking whatever he could get his hands on to dull his pain and guilt.\n\nBut one day, it suddenly changed. After an evening locked naked in his room with nothing but a carton of cigarettes, three bottles of vodka, and a book on Orthodox mysticism, he walked out proclaiming that he had been ordered to reunite Russia. By whom? He declines to say. His officer comrades were worried for his mental state, a fear exacerbated when Krylov crowned himself as Rurik II, Emperor and Autocrat of all the Rus'. However, their concerns were drowned out by a wave of support from soldiers and mercenaries, drawn by promises of conquest and glory.\n\nRurik preaches an eclectic mix of Russian traditionalism and Soviet militarism. He claims to be the heir to the Tsarist tradition, yet despises the Romanovs; he talks about the virtue of Vladimir the Great, but is atheist and dismisses priests as "charlatans and wizards". His motley ideology is represented by his supporters, a mix of reactionaries, Soviet veterans, and soldiers of fortune. Some in his officer corps suspect that the whole "Rurik" act is simply a charade to rally the peasants' support; if it is, he is doing an exceptionally good job at staying in character."

 POLITICS_KING_YURIY_DESC:0 "If you had told Yuriy Nikolayevich Krylov two decades ago that he would one day stand at the helm of a rejuvenated Russian monarchy, he would've no doubt been in a state of sheer disbelief. Yet, in a truly bizarre series of events, Yuriy has risen to become the undisputed successor to his father's almost heroic legacy.\n\nAs a young man, Yuriy took after his father and joined the army of the Central Siberian Republic as an officer, where he distinguished himself as an energetic and capable leader. During his time on the front, he saw firsthand the devastating effects of war upon the poor and disadvantaged of Russia. Although he continued to rise through the ranks, Yuriy became frustrated with his inability to make a real difference in the name of the people. \n\nYuriy's life would soon become even more hectic when his father suffered what appeared to be a severe mental break. When he emerged again as Rurik II, he was quick to establish his progeny as nobility in his self-proclaimed kingdom. After a short period of confusion and concern for his father, Prince Yuriy eventually came to see the kingdom as a chance to make his ideals a reality. The path towards the crown was fraught with political intrigue, but despite these challenges Yuriy would eventually be named as Rurik II's rightful successor.\n\nNow christened as Rurik III in honor of his late father, the King intends to make good on his lofty goals. Under his reign, Rurik III intends to lay the foundations of a more fair and just kingdom, one which looks to the rights of its people first and foremost."

 POLITICS_QUEEN_LYDIA_DESC:0 "From the chaos and confusion of the Russian warlord era arises Rogneda I, the Wolf Queen of Rus'. The woman formerly known as Lydia Krylova's rise to power was nothing short of meteoric, and she now stands tall as the most powerful authority of the resurrected Russian nation.\n\nIt was not always destined to be like this. Once upon a time, Lydia was a volunteer nurse helping with the rear echelon of the Central Siberian Republic's military. What she witnessed during her time shaped her character dramatically: countless men and women putting their lives on the line for causes they did not fully understand, without any indication that their sacrifices were making a difference. Russia was dying, and this could not be more tangible to Lydia, who was able to witness the effects of these death throes with her own eyes.\n\nWhen her father emerged from his mental lapse as Rurik II, Lydia immediately saw this as her opportunity to turn the tide. As the Kingdom's power continued to grow, so too did the Wolf Princess'. Eventually, she was forced to compete with her own brother for the throne, but her passionate and ruthless drive saw Lydia through to take his place as Rurik II's rightful heir.\n\nNewly reborn as Queen Rogneda, she intends to restore strength and honor to the wounded Russia nation, no matter what the cost may be."

 ### Ideas ###
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom:0 "Esoteric Kingdom"
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom_desc:0 "His Majesty Rurik II is a man burning with desire to see all traitors and all despoilers of Holy Russia perish. Normally, this would be the kind of man our shattered land would need, but his mental state has led to him developing some... interesting ideas as to how the Restoration of the Motherland should proceed. Some may find hope and inspiration in his drive, true, but most of his neighbors would only see a madman."

 KEM_the_two_wolves:0 "The Two Wolves"
 KEM_the_two_wolves_desc:0 "The King's children, Yuriy and Lydia, while both exemplary advisors and administrators, each have their own, radically different ways of governance. Prince Yuriy favors a lighter, more populist touch, and urges his father to give his subjects the power to decide their own fates.\n\nPrincess Lydia, on the other hand, espouses a more militaristic, hierarchical ideal. She urges her father to closen his relationship with the military and to distance himself from the commoners, for none of them are as fit as he to wear the burden of leadership upon their shoulders."

 KEM_kings_unions:0 "The King's Unions"
 KEM_kings_unions_desc:0 "In a bizarre symbiosis of the ancient ways of the Rus and the modern ideals of the Bolsheviks, King Rurik has declared that trade unions will be free to operate within reason. This has, surprisingly, served the King well, as the peasants who might otherwise call for his overthrow are now placated by their state-sponsored Unions. However, if the people are given a taste of freedom, who knows where it may lead them?"

 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king:0 "Reign of the Mad King"
 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king_desc:0 "Nikolay Krylov, now known as Rurik the Second, has so far proved to be an exceptionally eccentric ruler. His rule thus far has demonstrated his continuous ability to contradict himself on several subjects, and few believe that this ability will end any time soon. The Mad King has also decided upon strengthening the military in order to strike out against our neighbors, which he sees as rebellious subjects.\n\nThere is clearly plenty the King has to do before he can embark on the warpath. The King's children are both attempting to persuade His Highness to follow their visions for how to prepare the kingdom for the future wars. Judgments will have to be made on whether to follow the populist policies of Prince Yuriy or the brutal pragmatism of Princess Lydia.\n\nRurik will need to determine the direction of the economy, the army and the society he wishes to establish. Once these challenges have been overcome, we can set out on the warpath."

 KEM_the_kings_industry:0 "The King's Industry"
 KEM_the_kings_industry_desc:0 "After the past deterioration of our standing in the region, it was assumed that we were doomed to obscurity due to our complete lack of fortune. Or so it seemed, after all we still control the industrious city of Kemerovo.\n\nIf we were to utilize and advance the output of the city, producing new guns and equipment, equipping freshly trained soldiers and extending these plans to enhance our infrastructure, improving the mobility of our army and workers.\n\nMaybe we could once again take our place as a relevant contender in the region under the ambitious King Rurik II."

 KEM_support_the_unions:0 "Support the Unions"
 KEM_support_the_unions_desc:0 "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nCrown Yuriy Krylov has expressed his support for the existing trade unions, emphasizing how expansion of our output will never be sustainable without the support of the workers in the factories.\n\nThis choice will pose a bizarre conflict to the new monarchy which his majesty has created, but such an unusual contradiction will be nothing new to those who know the king."

 KEM_the_will_of_the_people:0 "The Will of the People"
 KEM_the_will_of_the_people_desc:0 "Now that His Highness has determined on following a more progressive approach to our economy, we shall endeavour to begin laying out the new foundations of our supportive economy.\n\nNew legislation will be put into place to protect the rights of the kingdom's loyal and diligent industrial workers and unions will be strengthened. Popular policies like these will be necessary if we are to keep our working classes devoted to the cause of the king.\n\nFor the will of the people shall not be ignored for as long as King Rurik is around to hear it."

 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king:0 "And the Power of the King"
 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king_desc:0 "His Highness has heard the outcry of the people and he has listened, our recent attempts at restructuring the economy have proved very popular with the poorer members of our society.\n\nImprovements in the conditions of workers have already begun to improve, along with popular support for the king's rule. But if these trends are to continue, power will have to remain in the hands of the king, after all his grace has proved himself to be a worthy leader of the working classes.\n\nThe cooperation of the people with the authority of the monarch will be required if our economy is to improve."

 KEM_a_change_in_course:0 "A Change in Course"
 KEM_a_change_in_course_desc:0 "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nPrincess Lydia Krylova has planned to set out a proposal to the economic minister, Lev Voznesensky, which would undermine the current rights of workers, but significantly increase the extent of our production. After all, trade unions and collective action will only serve their own interests and oppose the greater aspirations of the king. If we were to put these plans into action, the king may lose the support of the workers in the future.\n\nWe must hope they can see the kingdom's true potential."

 KEM_lean_right:0 "Lean Right"
 KEM_lean_right_desc:0 "The time has come to break with the outdated economic system that our kingdom currently upholds, unions and worker's rights have proven only to be obstacles to our economic potential.\n\nRemoving these laws and significantly reducing the power of the unions, will certainly benefit our short term output and remove a substantial amount of power from the hands of the union leaders. But we continue to run the risk of antagonizing the working classes, as they still believe that the old system works best for them.\n\nRegardless of this risk, we shall push ahead with the necessary reforms to unleash our as yet unrealized economic potential."

 KEM_a_truly_free_market:0 "A Truly Free Market"
 KEM_a_truly_free_market_desc:0 "Following the success of our recent reforms to the economy, it is obvious that we should continue to pursue the plan put forward by Princess Lydia and liberate the markets from its remaining restrictions.\n\nState intervention will be limited and the last of the unions will be muzzled, in order to create an environment for a truly free market.\n\nSoon we will only need to wait for the inevitable boost to the efficiency of our industry that will inevitably arrive, establishing a great advantage over our surrounding enemies."

 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age:0 "An Economy for the Modern Age"
 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age_desc:0 "We have, at long last, completed the necessary reforms to our industry that will develop a suitable base for future production. The direction of the royal economy has ultimately been decided, for better or for worse, the days of our ineffective economy are gone, and Kemerovo has truly become home to an economy fit for the modern age. The extra capacity that our changes have brought will prove instrumental to our future prospects in the region.\n\nHis Majesty is pleased with the kingdom's progress, there is now a lot less holding back the King's immense ambitions."

 KEM_the_kings_society:0 "The King's Society"
 KEM_the_kings_society_desc:0 "The order of the kingdom's society is yet to be determined, two clear options from His Highnesses' children have emerged. First, the ideals of Prince Yuriy, which would remarkably improve the political rights of the people of Kemerovo and promote equality amongst the population.\n\nAlternatively, Princess Lydia offers a more pragmatic vision of Kemerovo's society, which would entail closer links with the military and an enforcement of a strict hierarchy to ensure stability.\n\nWhoever King Rurik decides to follow, will have an increase in their power and influence within the realm."

 KEM_prince_yuriys_ideals:0 "Prince Yuriy's Ideals"
 KEM_prince_yuriys_ideals_desc:0 "Crown Prince Yuriy, the heir to the throne, has attempted to influence the king to make reforms to increase the freedoms and power of the people. The prince argues that his idealistic vision will inspire people, whereas his sisters' bleak, repressive structure for society will only create resentment.\n\nA liberated population will limit resistance to the rule of the king; our subjects throughout the rest of Central Siberia will also be less inclined to resist us.\n\nPrince Yuriy assures His Highness that these adjustments will ensure the realms stability and prospects for the future."

 KEM_king_ruriks_revolutionary_past:0 "King Rurik's Revolutionary Past"
 KEM_king_ruriks_revolutionary_past_desc:0 "Prince Yuriy has decided to popularize the old values that King Rurik fought for when he served as a revolutionary soldier of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the masses have been reminded of the King's history, they will be reassured that the rights they have maintained so far will be protected. Considering how Rurik has already preserved the state atheism of the Soviet Union the continuation of such policies will come as no surprise.\n\nHis Majesty will protect all from injustice, as he already and always will."

 KEM_a_kingdom_of_equals:0 "A Kingdom of Equals"
 KEM_a_kingdom_of_equals_desc:0 "The Crown Prince has continued to advocate and implement his ideals across the realm, he now plans to promote programs that will improve equality throughout the kingdom. This, the Prince argues, will help dramatically improve the lives of the most impoverished members of society.\n\nPrince Yuriy, or the People's Prince as he has become known, continues to receive a large amount of popularity with the public, which in turn has increased his influence in the king's court.\n\nAn expansion of Prince Yuriy's authority will be good news for the poor, who genuinely believe that he has their interests at heart."

 KEM_the_zemsky_sobor_reborn:0 "The Zemsky Sobor Reborn"
 KEM_the_zemsky_sobor_reborn_desc:0 "The next major step in the Prince's reforms is the reform of the Kingdom's Assembly, the Zemsky Sobor. Not used since the seventeenth century, the Sobor had been recreated in Kemerovo to give the subjects access to the King.\n\nGiving more power to the Sobor will make the people's voice even more important to the King. It will also bring Prince Yuriy closer to building a truly democratic and representative parliamentary monarchy that serves the people."

 KEM_princess_lydias_pragmatism:0 "Princess Lydia's Pragmatism"
 KEM_princess_lydias_pragmatism_desc:0 "Contrary to her brother's beliefs, Princess Lydia believes in a pragmatic approach when it comes to modeling the king's society. She has endeavoured to sway King Rurik to her beliefs by undermining Prince Yuriy's attempts to force His Highness to surrender more and more power to the people.\n\nInstead, she insists that the king should rule in an increasingly authoritarian manner, employing the force of the royal armed forces to keep his people in check. All that Princess Lydia believes will come of her brothers reforms is weakness or worse, revolution.\n\nSo, for the sake of the stability and longevity of the kingdom, she will continue to endorse the formation of an authoritarian kingdom."

 KEM_the_kings_military_heritage:0 "The King's Military Heritage"
 KEM_the_kings_military_heritage_desc:0 "Prince Lydia has begun to promote his majesties past as a skilled and feared warrior, who fought bravely against the Germans during the Great Patriotic. She will also mention her father's doomed struggle against the anarchist insurgency of the Siberian Black Army.\n\nLydia hopes to succeed in creating widespread support for a larger and more powerful military. She hopes that others will start to recognize her belief that a stronger military is not only necessary for the defence of Kemerovo, but essential to the salvation of Russia."

 KEM_fire_and_blood:0 "Fire and Blood"
 KEM_fire_and_blood_desc:0 "What is a monarchy without its nobles? Without its aristocrats? Without its Generals? Without its structure?\n\nIt becomes nothing more than an anarchic corruption of what it pretends to be. With a powerless and empty figurehead as its face. Lydia has taken it upon herself to prevent this nightmare from becoming a reality.\n\nShe intends to create a society with a strict hierarchy at its heart, with the militarists and righteous nobles at the very top."

 KEM_kingsguard_primacy:0 "Kingsguard Primacy"
 KEM_kingsguard_primacy_desc:0 "The Kingsguard was brought into existence very soon after Lydia's father proclaimed himself Rurik the Second, they have remained well equipped and relevant in the court of the king, but many guards have greater ambitions.\n\nPrincess Lydia plans to help fulfil them in exchange for an increase in her own influence over the veteran unit. She promises riches and glory from fighting in the kingdom's future conquests, all she wishes in return is the ability to exert her authority over the guard whenever she believes it is required."

 KEM_our_realm_secured:0 "Our Realm Secured"
 KEM_our_realm_secured_desc:0 "With the changes to the King's new society made, and the wolves appeased - if only temporarily – our state can focus its attention on other concerns, in preparation for our expansion. The new model of society has started to bring stability to the realm, something that has relieved everyone, from the farmer toiling on their collective farm, to the King himself.\n\nHis Highness hopes that the internal squabbles between his children have ended, not just for the sake of his own threadbare sanity, but also the kingdom's longevity as a whole."

 KEM_the_kings_army:0 "The King's Army"
 KEM_the_kings_army_desc:0 "The Royal Armed Forces are pitifully small and armed with only the most basic of weapons. Their commander's tactics are ancient, dating back to the German invasion. The military needs to be changed if we want to have any hope of defending ourselves and defeating the rebellious subjects outside our borders.\n\nTo make an army our King would be proud of, our small forces must be increased to a full standing army to defend the nation. That means even more men will need to join our forces if we want to have the chance at victory. We must also increase our military production to arm the new recruits. Lastly, our tactics must be retouched to fight a modern war in the Siberian Wasteland. The Royal Army must never lose!"

 KEM_a_standing_army:0 "A Standing Army"
 KEM_a_standing_army_desc:0 "To defeat our enemies we cannot have an untrained rabble. The core of our military must be made up of professional soldiers who are willing to fight for our King and his ideals. With a well trained and professional military, even the largest of enemies can be bested. We shall stand above the other traitorous warlords who wish to conquer and destroy our kingdom.\n\nWhile it may take some time to fully professionalize our military, it will be worth it in the end. Better training and better officers will whip the troops into shape. Our army will be the most distinguished and magnificent in Siberia!"

 KEM_defensive_doctrine:0 "Defensive Doctrine"
 KEM_defensive_doctrine_desc:0 "With the current state of Russia, invasion could come at any time anywhere. Fortifications, watchtowers, and radar stations must be constructed in easily defendable positions so that we know when and where an invasion is coming. With our enemies most likely outnumbering us, the army must be trained to defend and ambush.\n\nThe kingdom must always stay on guard, in the forts, the bunkers, and trenches.

With some hard negotiations and a little luck, companies from all around the world will come to our shores in no time, and the crown shall reap the lucrative rewards of their business."

 KEM_the_modern_catherine_desc:0 "Thanks to the intelligent council Crown Princess Lydia has given to her father, the kingdom has been rejuvenated with newfound strength. She has worked day and night to forge a united Russia that would stand the test of time, with a powerful military at her command and a strong free market economy. Lydia's deeds have become renowned across the realm, and there is little doubt that she would be a worthy heir to Rurik II.\n\nMuch like her father, Lydia has become subject to a heroic myth of her own. The aggressiveness of her reforms have transformed the kingdom into a mighty state indeed, and comparisons are being drawn to the great revival Russia experienced under Catherine the Great over 200 years ago. Lydia has encouraged these comparisons, being a great admirer of the great empress herself.\n\nRurik II grows older by the day. There are worries that he may not be much longer for this world, but at least when that horrible day comes, the kingdom will have a strong leader ready to take the wheel. All hail King Rurik II! All hail Crown Princess Lydia!"

 KEM.1.t:0 "The King in Kemerovo"
 KEM.1.desc:0 "Sergei walked up the long and heavily decorated stairs leading into the Grand Palace of Kemerovo, the residence of the great Rurik the Second and his family. He could not help but notice the signs of destruction from the days of the Siberian War in what used to be the local Gorkom headquarters. Thankfully, the new rulers of the land had gone to great lengths to hastily repair the building. The Rurikid ensign was visible in every object and wall, often simply replacing the hammer and sickle, and more than likely bolstering the ego of General Nikolay Krylov. Modern comforts were combined with medieval architecture in an unexpected way.\n\n"You shall have an audience with His Majesty in precisely two hours", was the response of the secretary. Until then, Sergei could admire the wonderful artwork and furniture, occasionally peeking out of the window to enjoy the view of the central square - even though the arrival of winter discouraged many from spending time there.\n\nAt exactly twelve o'clock, the wooden doors of the palace opened, and Sergei entered the King's residence not as a noble or a general, but a mere businessman. On an expensive throne, Rurik II sat and observed the economist with a judging look. Just as all the dozens of other men to have entered the room, Sergei truly had to prove his value to the mad king and his advisors. Undisturbed by the situation he was in, he outlined his plan of economic development and won the trust of the Royal Court, which seemed open to inviting him again. For all the rumours of him being an insane and brutal king, Rurik seemed awfully logical and pragmatic in person.\n\nThe man left the Palace, unsure if the story of Kemerovo's Tsar was a farce or a tragedy. Either way, that did not have an impact on the situation on the ground: the state was surrounded by enemies, and the choice of siding with the General was dangerous to make. Yet that did not stop some of his more affectionable subjects from doing just that."

 KEM.2.t:0 "His Majesty's Eccentricities"
 KEM.2.desc:0 "To call General Nikolai Krylov - or Rurik II "eccentric" was perhaps the largest understatement in all of Russia. He awoke in the early hours of the morning before anyone else in his household, was constantly drunk, and shied away from loud noises. He spoke softly, yet firmly, and seemed exactly of sound mind even while addressing himself as Tsar; or firmly insisting he be called Rurik II to everyone who called General Krylov by his old name.\n\nOccasionally, the servants mused amongst themselves about the king whilst he roamed the palace or resided on his throne. Was he truly mad? Was this what the horrors of war brought? No, others argued. The General is merely putting on an act to confuse and bewilder others. Yet, all of them knew the others had no concrete answer. The Tsar certainly gave none.\n\nWhat of it, then? If they were following a lunatic, he was a benevolent one who treated them well. If they were following a man talented enough to put on such an act, then clearly they were working for one of the greatest minds in Siberia. These thoughts at least, put them at ease as the breaks ended, or the Tsar called for them.\n\nYet still, the question lingered."

The cadets stopped what they were doing and scrambled to fall in line, wiping mud off their uniforms and trying to keep their rifles clean.\n\nIvan looked at the men and sighed. They were miserable, no doubt. Most of them were probably farmers' sons, used to hard labor, but not this much exertion for so long. He could see the resentment in their eyes, which he figured was a start. He would rather have trained men who hated him than green men who adored him.\n\n"Men," Ivan began, "you may be wondering why I had you out here since dawn, with no food, and me breathing down your necks at the slightest mistake. I know you are suffering. In fact, I WANT you to be suffering. Because the more you suffer here, the less you will suffer out there. I would rather your legs give out on the obstacle course than on the march. I would rather your first day without food be in the camp than in a foxhole. And I would certainly rather you find out your limits training than in battle against the Tsar's foes!\n\n"I do not expect your love! I do not expect your thanks! I do not expect even the slightest hint of warmth from any of you! But what I DO expect is that you will fight when ordered and keep fighting until your body can fight no more! Am I clear?"\n\nIvan received a chorus of "Yes sir"s in response.\n\n"Good! Now run the course again!" He blew the whistle, and the men scrambled to the start of the course.

Voznesensky loudly cleared his throat. "Let me try and understand this. Prince Yuriy, you suggest that His Majesty concentrate on workers' rights reforms in order to improve quality of life?

Ivan had come to expect the unexpected during his many years as an industrial worker, but not even he could expect someone like King Rurik II to take charge. The King, long may he reign, was certainly a strange one, especially considering that Ivan remembered the times he used to call himself 'General Krylov' and would stagger out of the old Gorkom headquarters to give slurred speeches about traitors and mutiny.\n\nDespite the King's many, many eccentricities, ol' King Rurik II seemed to be a good man to follow. He hadn't done anything malicious or harmful to people like Ivan so far, in fact he seemed to really be dedicated to taking care of the Kemerovo's people. He made sure that the common man felt safe and protected, which Ivan had thought impossible ever since the Huns took Moscow. His outfits and palace might be a tad odd, but when he gave a speech, even a weary old man like Ivan felt in awe. Ivan even felt like King Rurik's strange little regime had a decent enough shot of liberating Russia from its many fractured rulers. If King Rurik ended up ruling all of Russia, why, Ivan felt like that wouldn't be too bad."

 KEM.6.desc:0 "Prince Yuriy roamed through the bustling town center full of people going about their lives - buying from the markets, enjoying a day at the park, and gossiping to one another. Yuriy enjoyed coming here and being around all the people who were just going about their daily lives and enjoying what they can. It was somewhat calming, and a good break from the throne room and his cynical sister.\n\nThere was still something off-putting, however. Wherever Yuriy went, there was a sense of fear. Fear of bandits, fear of raids. Fear of invasions from other warlords, and the fear that their family wouldn't have enough to eat that night. It was there and almost everywhere Yuriy went.\n\nThe people couldn't live like this, Yuriy thought. All the dread and despair deep inside everyone, it was unbearable. Every time he went to visit the town, he felt like something had to be done. Anything to improve people's lives, at least somewhat.\n\nWhat was he thinking, he was a prince! If someone could do something to help the people, it was him. Sure, his father did seem to care a lot for his Kingdom, but from what Yuriy saw, it wasn't enough. More had to be done if Kemerovo were to be the grand kingdom that cared for its people."

"Fellow people of this great kingdom, may you be nobles, priests, or commoners, I welcome you. As you know, the current state of Russia is not ideal. Poverty and banditry are rampant, and starvation is the norm. Warfare has destroyed what were once great cities and will continue to do so."\n\nYuriy began to speak louder now, more energized than he had ever felt before. "This cannot continue to go on! Something has to be done, the people of our kingdom cannot continue to live in impoverishment. That is why I believe everyone deserves equality under their King. Life in fear and terror is not a way to live! If we are to be a modern Kingdom, we need to follow new ways. The welfare of the people must be assured, a King and his government cannot ignore their own citizens."\n\nYuriy looked around the room to see the people's reactions. Were they happy, eager even? It was hard to tell, so Yuriy continued. "That is why I hope this realm can become a better one. One with a parliamentary democracy, where everyone can have their voices heard, and the King can act on the will of his subjects. Those are my hopes and my dreams.

While not limiting the power of Rurik much, the voice of the people in government affairs has greatly increased. Now, Rurik has the opportunity to hear the opinions of his subjects even more, and it's safe to say the Kingdom is slowly moving towards democracy.\n\nWhile this does give more power to the common people of Kemerovo, the added power has also increased the influence of the nobles and priests as well. The common people may be able to voice their opinions now, but the rich nobleman now has the opportunity to use his influence in other means. The reformed Sobor may not be perfect, but in Yuriy's mind, the more voice the people have in government, the better.\n\nAnd while Yuriy may be satisfied for now, there is still much the Prince wants to see changed for the Kingdom can become a better place for everyone. Now was just the beginning of a new kingdom, a better kingdom."

 KEM.9.desc:0 "The Wolf Princess prowled through the halls of King Rurik's Court. Princess Lydia enjoyed watching her father make decisions. A ruler had to be decisive, a wrong decision could turn entire empires upside down. Monarchs were the best for laying down the law of the land, and they knew how to use their authority.\n\nEver since the end of the wars in Russia and Siberia, the Krylov family had changed. With her father carving out a fiefdom in Central Siberia, the entire family now had their own ideas on how to fix Russia. The Princess felt the best way to lead the kingdom was with a strong autocrat. Prince Yuriy, on the other hand, thought the best way was to follow the opinions of the people. Where he was idealistic, she was pragmatic. Where her brother was pacifistic, she was militaristic. Ironic, considering her past as a nurse, but necessary in the new order of things. Her brother just didn't understand the world they now lived in. Did he really think all the enemies that surrounded them would just hand over control to their father?\n\nNo, and that's where Yuriy would fail. Her goal wasn't to sit in Kemerovo and try to grow more food for the people while bandits continue to raid farms and murder their owners. Her goal - their family's goal, was to reunite Russia. Only then could the people be fed and their lives be improved. Russia could not be made whole if they couldn't make some small sacrifices.\n\nLydia had to just make sure her father made the right decisions."

Her brother, Yuriy, had not shown up as he was supposed to. How careless, he couldn't see how they were creating a more refined Kemerovo. Democracy could not work in a Kingdom. How could he not see that?\n\nIt took a lot less than she thought to transform an entire society, she wondered. One decree made by her father and an entire class system could be built out of nothing. A new hierarchy, she thought. The kingdom could only be ruled by order, and without order, there would be turmoil.\n\nThe new society that would be created would finally allow the elites to be on top. Her father would rule over a perfect and neat structure, where everyone knew their place. The noble's and military's rights to power would finally be upheld.\n\nAs Lydia watched her father sign her creation into law, she knew his Kingdom had become even more perfect. Kemerovo had to be kept powerful and out of the hands of uneducated peasants who know nothing about ruling a nation. A guiding hand, led only by the King and the nobility would lead to the defeat of their enemies. Society would be purified through fire and blood, or it would not be pure at all."

While we completed some reforms to improve the lives of the workers, it might not have been enough. Critics of the reforms have stated they did not go even close to creating a lasting effect. Conditions continue to be unsafe and wages are not enough to support an acceptable living.\n\nUnfortunatly with our budget stretched thin the reforms could have only gone so far.

A trader from outside this strange kingdom, it was nothing he was used to back home.\n\nHow it must have changed from just a few years prior! What was once a dead economy with only poor farmers and laborers was becoming more modern by the day. Perhaps the quirky king knew a lot more about leading than anyone thought. It certainly seemed like it.\n\nAnd the people! Oh, they were an interesting sight. No one dressed like them anywhere else in Russia, that was for sure. But it wasn't how they were dressed that was the most interesting thing, their actions were even more colorful than their looks. Formal yet casual, joyful yet serious. The people really were just like their King.\n\nZemislav would be spending a few more days before he left for home. Perhaps he would stay even longer than he thought.

As each of the children entered, things started well. Rurik decided to steer towards something all of them would enjoy, the unification of Central Siberia under him as King.\n\nIt wasn't long until Lydia decided to take the conversation in a different direction though. "If we want to unify the region, the military needs even more funding, Father. We need to make sure we conquer our enemies swiftly before any of them can put up a strong resistance."\n\n"What are you talking about Lydia", Yuriy said, opposed to anything she said. "More has to be done for our subjects, not the military. Besides, should we not try to approach things diplomatically first?"\n\n"Are you that naive, brother?" Lydia responded coldly. "Do you really think the surrounding warlords will just let us peacefully integrate them? The Germans will just hand back Moscow?\n\nYuriy stuttered, to the delight of Lydia, "No-I..."\n\n"Be quiet! Both of you!" King Rurik interjected, angry that nothing had changed between them, despite all his efforts. "I brought you here so you could finally get along. For the sake of the Kingdom, just end your bickering. Boris, you haven't said much, what do you think we should do next?"\n\nBoris looked to his two siblings, both angrily eyeing him as he prepared to speak. "I don't know, father.

Her Russian had a noticeable Ukrainian accent, and King Rurik admittedly didn't catch every word she said. Nevertheless, her speech resonated with her troops, who applauded as King Rurik appointed her officially to the rank of General. After she concluded her speech, Princess Lydia gave a speech of her own. The Shieldmaidens had originally been her idea, and she gave a passionate speech about how the bravest soldiers in the realm will now finally have their chance to display their bravery upon the battlefield. Once she concluded, King Rurik stepped forward.\n\nHe thanked the shieldmaidens for choosing to serve their King in the most honorable fashion. No longer would the realm deprive women their chance to fight the enemies of the King upon the grand battlefield that Russia had become.

"SUBJECTS, LOYAL MEN, FELLOW RUSSIANS!" his voice boomed over the speakers. "The time for which you have trained is upon you! Your homeland lies sundered, divided between a hundred bandit princes! They desecrate the corpse of Mother Russia! They cheer as they rape her body, smile as they bathe in her blood, and laugh as they feast upon her children! And they dare to do it while you watch!\n\n"But watch we shall NOT!" The soldiers were listening intently to Rurik's every word, a thousand eyes boring into him. "We-YOU-shall not stand by! You shall take up the sword once held by your forefathers! You shall strike the foe before you, as we struck the Tatar, the Mongol, the Cossack, and the German once before! You shall pry those who defile the motherland out of their lairs and cast them into the fire! And there shall come a day, God willing, when your valor and sacrifice unite Mother Russia once more!

Prince Yuriy also attempted to integrate as much of the former Tomsk police force as was possible, so that the citizens of Tomsk could trust those patrolling their streets.\n\nAbove all else, Prince Yuriy wished to embrace the cultural riches of Tomsk. Tomsk had long attracted artists and visionaries from across Russia, an artistic safe haven amongst a sea of violence and repression. Prince Yuriy continued this tradition, sponsoring many artists and musicians, and hosting numerous exhibitions for Tomsk's art scene.\n\nWith Tomsk having had a strong democratic tradition ever since the Central Siberian Republic of old, republican sentiment naturally runs high in the city. In order to combat this, Prince Yuriy created some elected positions within his Tomsk government. Combined with additional sponsoring and funding of pro-Rurikid artists and politicians, Prince Yuriy attempted to sideline republican sentiment through peaceful means primarily, only using violence as a last resort."

Lydia, long a proponent of the creation of a new aristocracy, found her allies in the industrialists of Tomsk. She stacked her administration with these wealthy industrialists, subsidizing their factories and businesses, and having them don the same decorum as the rest of Kemerovo's Royal Court. Lydia's goal as Governor was to make Tomsk a productive asset of King Rurik's realm, so that he may better be able to unite Russia, as is his destiny.\n\nAs part of making Tomsk a productive asset to the King, Lydia also funded infrastructure. She ensured that the roads were safe and well-maintained, that factories were functioning at full-capacity, and that the administration was loyal and well-disciplined. She also funded hospitals, as a healthy populace was a productive populace, and the invasion of Tomsk had overwhelmed what remained of its previous health infrastructure.

Formerly known as Major General Nikolay Krylov, King Rurik had come to understand his destiny, and overcome his failures. The Siberian Black Army had been subjugated, the anarchist experiment a failure. The traitor general Nikolai Andreev had been brought to justice, and Krasnoyarsk reintegrated. Novosibirsk, led by Alexander Pokryshkin, the Siberian Falcon, now served King Rurik in his conquests with its vast industry, population, and resources. The People's Revolutionary Council had been defeated, the socialist cause taking yet another blow. Tomsk, the last remnants of the Central Siberian Republic, now a loyal subject under the King.\n\nWith all of Central Siberia now united under the King of Rus, King Rurik is now a powerful contender for uniting all of Russia, as unlikely as it may have seemed once upon a time. King Rurik's eccentric persona, beloved by the common people, is now well known across both Russia, and even the international community. Who knows what the future holds for this glorious realm, now that it may very well hold the fate of all of Russia in its hands. Of course, King Rurik's dreams are not yet achieved, and other contenders still threaten His Majesty and his realm from both the east and west.

No better example of that is the case of Prince Yuriy and Princess Lydia, who have occupied the latest session of the Sobor with an hours-long debate on how the newly-annexed factories of Novosibirsk should be integrated into the royal economy.\n\n"Esteemed members of the Sobor, I highly recommend that you reject my dear sister's proposal on accounts that her actions are KILLING the loyal workingmen of Russia! I-"\n\nLydia didn't even wait for Yuriy to finish her sentence. "I call upon the Sobor to reject my brother's proposal, for following it will KILL our nation! We cannot afford to tie up our industry with red tape when we are surrounded by war! Better the men in the factories be a few kopeks short for a few years than for them to be slaves to bandits for the rest of their lives!"\n\nThat line really set Yuriy off. "A few kopeks?! How DARE you suggest it's that minor! My programs will save lives, while yours..."\n\nAs the siblings shouted at each other, the assemblymen of the Sobor (at least, those who could be bothered to stay awake) quietly judged them and weighed their options.

"Nonsense, Matvey! For you, I am still Nikolai Ivanovich!" He walked over to the samovar on an end table and grabbed the teapot atop it, filling two cups and adding cubes of precious pre-war sugar.\n\nThe following hours were filled with laughter while reminiscing about old escapades, tears shed for old friends long gone, and sobering silence as they realized they had once ordered thousands of their men to fight the other's.\n\n"At least," Shaposhnikov said as he sipped the last of his tea, "there will be no more bloodshed between our men. You have brought peace to this region, Nikolai Ivanovich."\n\nRurik sighed. "Aye, but not elsewhere. There will be more battles, and blood and death shall be left in their wake. Such is the price of reforging our homeland.\n\n"Russia is disparate, Matvey Kuzmich, and her people need something-someone-in whom they can place their trust." He smiled wryly at his old friend. "And who better to follow than the ghost of old Rurik, given life once again?"\n\nThe last of the tea grew cold, and Rurik dumped the dregs from his cup into the fireplace as he stood up.

Their disputes grow more venomous and destructive by the day, and I cannot bear to watch it any longer."\n\nBoris walked away from the map he had been presenting and sighed as he took a seat next to his father.

With the victory of His Majesty's armed forces, and the expansion of the realms's borders to encompass the entire Central Siberian region, the question has been raised of where exactly the Royal Court shall be located. Kemerovo was never intended to be the permanent center of royal authority, and was mostly chosen simply because it was the only noteworthy settlement available to us.\n\nNow that the region has been unified, we now have a few locations that could potentially be more suitable as the administrative center of the realm. Novosibirsk is the most obvious choice, being the largest and most populous city in all of Siberia. On top of being a vital industrial center, the city benefits from well-developed infrastructure and a strong agricultural base.\n\nAlternatively, we could move the court to the city of Krasnoyarsk, formerly controlled by Nikolai Andreev and his mutineers. While not necessarily as populous as Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk is still quite large by Siberian standards, and most importantly of all, is home to a critical junction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. This fact alone makes the city an appealing choice indeed.\n\nOf course, we could always decide to just stay in Kemerovo. Of all the potential choices, Kemerovo is the most centrally located, and benefits from having been developed into the stronghold of royal authority for many years. Of course, there is also the sentimental value: Kemerovo was where our kingdom was proclaimed in the first place, after all."

Yes, today it may only be roads and telephone lines, but what of tomorrow? I wholeheartedly agree that the realm must be connected, but we cannot do it without the express consent of the people!" As always, Yuriy was nothing if not passionate.\n\nHis sister, Lydia, rolled her eyes. "Again with this talk of 'rights', Yuriy? How tiresome. Perhaps you would also like us to ask the ground if it would be okay for us to build on top of it? Maybe we should ensure that the God-given rights of the woodland animals aren't infringed upon either?" Laughter could be heard amongst some of the council in response.\n\nRurik II was distraught at the sight of his children arguing with each other in such a way, but did his level best not to show it. It was clear, however, that the two would not budge. Soon enough, the council would be looking to their king to break the deadlock..."

Prince Yuriy, now the heir to his father's legacy, rose from his seat. As he stood, silence once again washed over the room, and the entire council had turned their attention to their new Crown Prince. At such a sight, it was hard for Yuriy to avoid getting emotional.\n\n"I am deeply honored by your show of trust, father. Rest assured, your legacy shall not wither away with your passing. I will ensure that all the people of your realm are treated fairly and with the respect they rightfully deserve. Together, we shall work towards a more just kingdom, and a brighter future for all of Russia!" The applause resumed, more ferocious than last time. Yuriy couldn't help but notice that even those who had remained silent before had joined in.\n\nThe Crown Prince looked to Lydia, who had not so much as moved a muscle since the announcement. Her expression betrayed a deep anger, a fury so intense that it could not be expressed through words. Lydia suddenly locked eyes with her brother's, and Yuriy went cold. Her gaze pierced directly into Yuriy's soul, a stare almost murderous in nature. Turning away from her brother, Lydia got up from her seat and left the council chamber. Most were so swept up in the festivities, that they had neglected to notice the departure of the princess.\n\nDespite his victory, Yury couldn't help but feel some lingering regrets over the feud.

The newly-appointed Crown Princess and heir to the throne, Lydia, rose from her seat to address the Zemsky Sobor. As she stood before the entire council, silence had once again dominated the chamber.\n\n"From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for this great responsibility you have bestowed upon me, father. You will not find a soul more capable of continuing your glorious legacy as I. Know that I shall focus all of my efforts on continuing to bring strength and honor to the realm. I will not rest until the darkness that has befallen the Rus' has been banished through sheer force of will!"\n\nLydia's brief speech was punctuated by the boisterous return of the applause. As she surveyed the celebrations, Lydia felt more proud in that moment than any other in her entire life. Victory at last. Her wandering eyes eventually landed on her brother, Prince Yuriy, who had conspicuously abstained from joining in on the applause. As their eyes met, Lydia shot him a smug grin. Yuriy's disconnected demeanor quickly turned to that of smoldering anger, and the snubbed Prince quickly got up from his seat and made for the chamber's exit. Yuriy angrily slammed the door behind him, the noise startling some of the council members.\n\nAfter her brother departed, Lydia's smirk disappeared. She had secured the prize she had so desperately coveted, but was it really worth making an enemy of her own brother? Even now, the Crown Princess was not entirely sure."

Should the vision depicted within the model before him be realized, [KEM.Capital.GetName] would shine once more as a center of power fit for a monarch of Rurik II's stature.\n\nForeign Minister and Royal Architect Pyotr Baranovsky stood in the corner of the room looking on as his liege gleefully examined the model he had put together. Rurik II was usually a gloomy old fellow, but today his eyes betrayed the excitement of a child in a candy store. "I trust everything is to your liking, Your Grace?"\n\n"Masterful work as always, Baranovsky! Fleeting visions of Russia's past, transplanted into the present..." Rurik II's gaze remained focused on the model as he spoke, and he leaned in for a closer look. The proposed buildings were not unlike the kingdom itself- taking clear inspiration from the architectural legacy of medieval Russia, married with a sensibly modern touch. With walls of red and white crowned with a variety of garishly decorated roofs, the structures of the hypothesized city were a feast for the eyes.\n\nRurik finally managed to peel his attention away from the model and towards the architect. "Marvelous... simply marvelous. When can I expect the renovations to begin, Baranovsky?"\n\n"As soon as we are able, Your Grace. We just require-"\n\n"You will have it.

Disciplined, clean, and some of the finest men east of the Urals!"\n\nYakovlev's words had some merit, with Rurik having just seen the men perform a training exercise. They performed admirably, a far cry from the rag-tag, desperate men Rurik had left after Andreev's betrayal. Of course, there was still room for improvement, the equipment they carried was still outdated, albeit some progress there had been made in the last couple of months. Rurik brought up these concerns, amongst others, and Yakovlev largely agreed, "Yes, the situation regarding equipment and uniforms is less than desired, and the men can lose moral easier than I like, but I'd say that we've improved greatly, Your Majesty. If we ignore the issue of equipment, in which my hands are tied, how does Your Majesty feel about the state of your army"'\n\n'They seem more disciplined, you've done a lot of good work here, Yakovlev.

He needed to look beyond his own trusted allies, and look for candidates from elsewhere in Central Siberia. Specifically, the former generals of Novosibirsk, Tomsk, and the People's Revolutionary Council. If these men swear loyalty to King Rurik, we can pardon them for their crimes of aiding enemy regimes, and integrate them into our forces. Of course, some of King Rurik's advisors say that pardoning these former generals is too dangerous, and that we can't trust them.\n\nOnly a few advisors protest integrating the generals of Novosibirsk, whose ideology, or lack thereof, is most compatible with our own. They would be the easiest to integrate, but some worry they may attempt to overthrow the king in favor of the military, like they did to the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nThe generals of Tomsk are not rejected for fear of a military coup, instead we fear their ideology. The generals of Tomsk are feared to be radical republicans, and a number of the advisors protest their integration for this reason.\n\nThen there are the generals from the People's Revolutionary Council. Almost the entire court believes them to be unforgivable, and many call for the socialists to be rounded up and exiled away from the realm. However, some argue that any of their generals who can betray their Marxist ideals enough to swear fealty to King Rurik can be sufficiently trusted.\n\nAll of this discussion matters not, in the end, it is the King's decision to issue a royal pardon. Who will he choose?"

This claim can be corroborated with reports from the CIA, who confirm that there has indeed been a dramatic shift of the balance of power in the region. While they still do not have a clear picture of the situation, the implication suggests that this "Rurik II" may very well have become a powerful new player in the Russian game.\n\nMonarchist movements are nothing new to Russia, but we have so far been unable to find any man by the name of Rurik who holds a claim to the throne. Stranger still was the ambassador's appearance. Diplomatic officials who were present to witness the meeting described his attire as "straight out of a renaissance fair" and "worthy of a Halloween costume".\n\nEstablishment of diplomatic relations with this "Rurik" could provide much needed information on the dire situation in Russia, and his regime could potentially serve as a key partner for our potential strategic interests in the region.

This request is not to be taken lightly, and represents an important crossroads for relations with the bizarre Russian regime.\n\nWhile the Russian diplomats assure us that an investment would be of great benefit to both parties, some of our economists are not nearly as idealistic and consider the prospect a waste of America's valuable resources.

Their introduction was as rude as it was bizarre, after all, the rule of the Rurik dynasty over Russia had ended well over four centuries ago. Yet there they stood, impatiently waiting for their assumed meeting.\n\nApart from the initial confusion caused by their arrival, the ambassadors were ushered into the office of the Foreign Secretary.

His astonishment was only heightened when he learnt that they had succeeded in their task. They had forged a diplomatic connection with the empire in the east; such news, Baranovsky assumed, could only be good for the future of the kingdom he served.\n\nYet, as so often the case was for the Foreign Minister, there was plenty more work to be done.

Revealing a few faces that had become oddly familiar to the workers inside. They were the faces of the ambassadors of Rurik II, since they had been relocated into a more permanent location, they now sought to come to an agreement on Japanese investment. An offer which was readily accepted.\n\nThe Japanese ministers present needed little reminding of the hidden wealth of Siberia, which they knew would be fabulously profitable to exploit. The impeccably efficient techniques and machines of the Zaibatsu would only allow for more wealth to be generated. Such a result would only serve to benefit both sides.\n\nYet the risks of investing in such a volatile region remained heavy on the minds of both parties. Any investment at such a stage in time would surely be a gamble, prone to the many changes that were yet to shake Siberia.\n\nThe Russians were dismissed soon after and told to wait for an official response.

They could barely wait for their land to be made rich from foreing investment; fortunately for them, they did not have to suffer their impatience for long.\n\nVarious giant metal machines were to be carried across the Siberian plains until they were installed and left to stand, unmoving, to churn at the earth beneath them and uncover its hidden richness. In time all that will remain of such brutal efficiency will be scarred and empty land.\n\nHowever, these thoughts were not present for those in power. They knew that wealth was needed to better the lives of the king's subjects. Besides, it would be more practical for them to accept Japan's assistance as there are still more benefits that could be made from keeping them close."

Many would be left unemployed and the states finances would be much worse off as a result.\n\nIn the end all Baranovsky could come up with was the assurance that one day Siberia's vast wealth would be uncovered. For now the expanse of land under his highness's domain will remain undisturbed, but when it is inevitably exploited, the king's subjects will be richer for it."

He thought it better to keep it more authentic than diplomatic.\n\nRurik found the start of his writing the hardest, he had no idea where to begin let alone how to conclude the damned thing. Yet as the night went on, and the bottle on his desk got emptier, he realised that the words flowed from his pen with ease.\n\nBy the time he had scrawled his name at the bottom of the page he was quietly impressed with his efforts. Such length and such style could have only been the work of his genius. He did not bother to reanalyse what he wrote, instead he had it sealed and sent off right away.\n\nBaranovsky was quite taken aback once he had learnt of the news that the king had sent off the declaration without first requesting him to read over it.

He returned it into the envelope and decided against carrying it to the emperor personally, better not bother him with such trivialities. Besides he would like to read more of it, and he would have had it not been so awfully written, and in russian.\n\nInstead he found a translator who might have been able to read the appalling work easier than he had. Yet the translator struggled enormously with this task, the phrases were muddled, the word choices bizarre and the punctuation non-existent. Try as he might he could not decipher what was written, he even began to question whether it had been written in some other foreign language he had not heard of. The only part he could confidently decode was the name signed at the bottom:\n\n"Rurik II, Tsar and Autocrat of All Rus"\n\nThe foreign minister turned to the translator and asked:"

Then one day he collapsed at a meeting, having to be rushed to his room by his own generals. Despite expert care it soon became apparent to everyone the King was dying.\n\nThe King awoke one last time, finding himself surrounded by his family. His children at his bedside. Yurily and Lydia even putting aside their differences at least for the day. He hoped it would last, that they would finally come together as a family. Perhaps they were too far gone, but perhaps not. Regardless, it was not his heir he spoke to, for he had said all that needed to be said to them days ago. It was Boris, the one among them who never had aspirations beyond duty and family.\n\n"Tell me, are the people happy? Is our Kingdom strong enough?" The old king's voice was barely more than a whisper.\n\nBoris smiled. "Yes father, the Kingdom is strong. You've prepared us well for what's to come."\n\nRurik nodded, wiping the sweat from his brow. "Good, good. Then this whole charade was worth it in the end."\n\nHis children didn't question his final words. Perhaps assuming it was madness like others had done since the beginning. Perhaps it was madness, but that didn't matter. Russia was nearly whole again, united and strong. He had done all he could for the people, his heir would do so much more, of that he was certain. While he had regrets, Rurik II, King of the Rus, was satisfied with what he had built.\n\nAnd so Nikolai Ivanovich Krylov closed his eyes for the last time, his duty finally ending."

It was the people who made this kingdom possible after all; they deserved to see such a momentous occasion first hand.\n\nHe turned away from the railing, glancing briefly at his sister, who stared at him from the sidelines. Looking indignant and annoyed but not as angry as he once would have expected from her. He then looked at his father's crown, held by a union leader, selected by raffle for this occasion. He placed his hand on the crown, turning to speak into the microphone.\n\n"This crown is far more than a birthright, it is a vow, a promise to all the people of this great kingdom." He addressed the cheering crowd. "To uphold all my father has built for you. To ensure that your rights, your liberties, and your prosperity are all protected. That no enemy, foreign or domestic, will ever again threaten to take all you have earned in the past decade."\n\nYurily knelt, allowing the union leader to place the crown upon his head.

In the past, the Romanovs were crowned by a member of the church, as a sign their power ultimately came from god. The Rus had no time for such superstitious nonsense. The crown was held by one of the Queensguard, and no one would crown Lydia but herself. She grabbed the crown, one she had specifically made for her. Holding in her hands she felt a pain of regret. Her father was dead, her brother in exile. Whatever the kingdom would face in years to come, she would have to do it without them.\n\nShe killed such thoughts. For the sake of the kingdom she would have to move past these doubts, move past even being Lydia. Bury the Princess like she buried the nurse so long ago. She placed the crown atop her head.\n\n"All Hail Queen Rogneda, Queen of the Rus." The Queensguard declared to all gathered.\n\nRogneda rose from her throne as the people clapped. She allowed them a moment before she spoke.\n\n"We have come fair in recent years. From one tiny spot in the siberian wilderness we have managed to forge a vast and mighty empire, defeating all who dared challenge us." She declared to the hall. "But our duty is not over.

His rule had not been peaceful, and it had not been perfect, but he had achieved a great deal.\n\nThe sun was halfway below the horizon, the orange sky turning to red, and the red fading to purple. The first stars began to shine down from the heavens, outnumbered by the lights from the city below.The King grew weaker with every passing day, and he now needed a cane to move about his palace. Rurik knew he would not live to see Moscow freed from the Germans who enslaved his people. He would have to leave that duty to his successor, his heir. He knew that they could succeed, he believed he had prepared them well. His child would lead this Kingdom to greatness, and avenge the humiliation the Motherland had been put through. Nikolai Krylov chuckled, knowing that his children and the rest of the nation were so attached to the Rurikid ideals, the mask he had eventually become.\n\nThe sun was now below the horizon, and night had fallen over the Motherland once more.

Yuriy couldn't stop thinking about the look Lydia had given him that day in the Zemsky Sobor. This wasn't just a professional rivalry anymore, it was pure disdain- simmering hatred for the man who had deprived her of her destiny.\n\nYuriy achieved his victory, but did not feel the relief he was expecting. He still had work to do. The people of Russia now looked to him for guidance, eagerly expecting Yuriy to make good on his bold promises of reform, and the prince had no intention of letting them down. His efforts would begin as soon as possible, a herculean quest to reshape the kingdom from the bottom up. Yuriy cherished the thought of creating a nation that genuinely cared for its people, but he wondered how many more enemies he was going to make before that dream would become reality.\n\nThe prince was committed to making things right.

What right, he thought, did this upstart have to rip up a prestigious institution like the Kingsguard? The sound of his door opening disrupted his ruminations.\n\n"Sir, they're here! They've come to disarm us by force!" The commander's aide had a frantic look in his eyes.\n\n"Who's here? Is it the army?"\n\n"I'm not sure. I didn't recognize their uniforms. I suspect it might be our replacements." Yakov had suspected that the upstart prince already had a paramilitary force of his own ready to take the place of the Guard, and this news merely confirmed his suspicions. Not only was the Kingsguard being disbanded, but their successors were to have their baptism by fire. Yakov turned away from his aide to peer out the window. Armed troops wearing uniforms not unlike those of the Kingsguard were fanning out through the barracks. It wouldn't be long before they'd find their way to Yakov's office.\n\nSuch a brazen display of authority insulted the proud commander. Not only were the noble Kingsguard to be disbanded, but the prince clearly did not trust the Guard enough to allow them to do so on their own terms. Yakov dismissed the distraught aide, and took a seat at his desk as the sounds of running boots became audible from downstairs.

An air almost warm in nature began to take hold in the Zemsky Sobor, far different from the intimidating environment it presented in the past.\n\n"It is my belief that the formation of proper political associations would go great lengths towards ensuring healthy political discourse within the realm. With my father's blessing, I have already begun to work with several of my fellow council members to build the foundations of a truly democratic, parliamentarian kingdom. For too long we have lorded over our people, who were no better than slaves to royal authority. My friends, believe me when I say that we are on the road to creating a kingdom that serves the people, rather than ourselves"\n\nYuriy's speech, unsurprisingly, was met with overwhelming applause. There was little opposition to his plans of reform these days, and most of the Zemsky Sobor had already been convinced one way or the other that the prince had their best interests at heart. As the clapping continued, Yuriy glanced across the chamber at his sister. To the prince's surprise, Lydia had remained present through the entire meeting.\n\nLydia had clearly not shared the rest of the council's enthusiasm, but did not appear to have the usual look of quiet disgust.

I know you must despise me for what I did, and there's nothing I can say to change that. At the end of the day, though, we are siblings.

Lydia recalled that day in the Zemsky Sobor, when her brother angrily stormed out the chamber in a fit of rage. Betrayal by one's own kin is among the worst kind imaginable, and Lydia knew that Yuriy was not likely to forgive her any time soon.\n\nLydia made a hard decision when she decided to make a play for the throne: make enemies of your own brother, or abandon Russia to be consigned to the ashtray of history. In the end, the princess had chosen Russia. Yuriy can think what he wants, she thought. Lydia would not let familial quarrels stand in the way of her destiny.\n\nAs the princess finished her glass, a wolf howled in the distance. Tomorrow, her work begins."

It was a dreadfully dull afternoon, but the princess still tried her level best to approach this task with the very same meticulousness she had become known for. Lydia's attention was drawn to the sound of loud footsteps drawing closer. She lifted her head to see her brother, Yuriy, emerge from the half-open doorway. He did not look pleased.\n\n"What is the meaning of this, Lydia? You're making me the governor of Chukotka?"\n\nLydia gave a half-hearted sigh. "Are you not happy with your promotion, brother? I'll have you know that province was in need of-"\n\n"Do you think I'm fucking stupid?! This might as well be exile! You only want me out of the capital so you never have to hear my complaints ever again!" Yuriy's voice was raised to the brink of screaming.\n\n"Oh, Yuriy. It's never good enough for you, is it? You should be lucky you're being given a job at all. Everything I do, I do it for the good of the realm. If only you could understand that."\n\n"You walk down a dark road, Lydia. First you bring the Zemsky Sobor to heel, now you exile your own brother. This is not the way our kingdom should be governed, it goes against everything our father wanted!" Lydia looked distant as her brother spoke. "Please, sister. Exile me if you must, but do not allow yourself to become a tyrant. Russia has suffered through too many already."\n\nAs Yuriy turned to leave his sister's office, Lydia remained silent. Her brother's words had fallen on deaf ears."

 KEM_lydia.3.desc:0 "One by one, the new recruits of what would be the Queensguard traversed the obstacle course before them, moving at a breakneck pace that would break those of a weak constitution. These hardy women were handpicked from various units of the Royal Army, some with years of service to the King under their belt. The Queensguard, however, was a cut above the regular army unit. Only the most elite of the elite were going to make it.\n\nToday, the recruits found themselves under more pressure than usual. Anna Kotsur, the newly promoted captain of the unit, was supervising the training; there would be no room for mediocrity under her watch.\n\n"Faster, you wretches, FASTER! Move you like your lives depend on it!" Kotsur had been yelling encouragement of a similar nature all afternoon. The voice of their captain felt like a cattle prod to the recruits, forcing them to push their bodies as far as they could go. Her gaze wandering towards the back of the squad, Kotsur couldn't help but notice one of the recruits was struggling to climb a rope.\n\n"Hey! You call that climbing?! Get your ass in gear!" The attention of her captain visibly caused the straining recruit even more stress. She was drenched in sweat, and her limbs shook under the strain. As the recruit attempted in vain to reach higher, she finally achieved her breaking point. Kotsur watched as the woman's face went white; letting go of the rope as she seemingly passed out. The unconscious recruit landed hard in the mud below as medics rushed from the sidelines to her aid. The captain shook her head. This one clearly did not have the makings of a Queensguard."

He turned to see if his wife was out late again, only to discover she was right next to him; still lost a deep sleep. The banging continued, loud enough to startle him despite being a few rooms away.\n\n"Damn it..." Semyon mumbled as he got out of bed. In this state, the journey to his front door was daunting indeed. The banging persisted, each sequence more loud than the last. Whoever it was, they were clearly impatient. "Just wait, I'm on my way! Good lord..." By the time he had reached the door, Semyon had mostly managed to regain his bearings. He took a peek through the peephole to see just who this late visitor was. What he saw made his blood run cold.\n\nThere were four large men, wearing uniforms resembling those of the police. Before he could react, the man in front kicked the door with all his might, causing it to fling open. Semyon yelled as he was knocked onto his back; the sound of heavy boots filled the room as the men moved inside.\n\n"Semyon Stoyanovich! By the order of His Majesty, you are under arrest for conspiring against the crown!" Semyon gave a confused look to the officer, words failing to form. The officers did not wait for his reply. One by one they grabbed Semyon by his arms, and began dragging him out of the room. Semyon saw his wife emerge just as the situation escalated.\n\n"Oh my god!" She cried, falling to her knees in despair. As Semyon was pulled into the hallway and out of her sight, he wondered if he'd ever see her again."

Thousands of the elite soldiers had arranged before their king in a strict and orderly fashion, eagerly awaiting his words. The rows of marines stretched nearly as far as the King could see. He cleared his throat, and began.\n\n"More than a millennium ago, ferocious sea-faring warriors roamed the countless rivers of the Rus'. The northmen would eventually assemble the foundations of what would become Russia, founding the great cities of Kiev, Novgorod, and countless others. The deeds of these great warriors continue to echo through the ages even to this day, and there is no greater proof of this than the stalwart men and women who stand before me today!"\n\n"You have all trained hard for this day, and now it has finally come. You, my brave Varyags, shall become the sword and shield of the Rus' on the waves. No waters will be too treacherous, no enemy too imposing, no victory too out of reach! Go now, my warriors, and make me proud. Your king shall observe your glorious exploits with great interest!"\n\nAs the King finished his speech, every single Varyag brought their heels together and gave a salute to their monarch. The soldiers then made a single, overpowering cry:\n\n"Long live the king!""

The horizon was entirely dominated with lights and tall buildings larger than anything he had seen in Russia. The King had heard Japan was an endless jungle of concrete and neon, but now he truly knew what they had meant. "So, this is what civilization looks like! Imagine if we had such structures back in [KEM.Capital.GetName]?"\n\nEntering the airport terminal, Rurik was immediately met with a large delegation of Japanese diplomats. Judging by the looks on their faces, they appeared quite excited to meet him. The man at the front of the group gave a bow. "Greetings, Rurik-sama! Allow me to extend a most warm welcome to Japan." The gleeful diplomat warmly offered a handshake to the king.\n\n"Thank you. By the way, it's Rurik." Rurik smiled nervously as he shook the diplomat's hand, who was visibly confused by the king's response.\n\n"Erm, yes, of course, Rurik-sama."\n\n"No, no. It's just Rurik. Ru-rik. Understand?"\n\n"I don't understand, Rurik-sama. Did I speak out of turn?"\n\nThe king became visibly flustered. "I told you, it's-" Before he could finish, Rurik was pulled to the side by one of his entourage, who leaned in to whisper into his ear.\n\n"Terribly sorry, Your Majesty, but he is merely using an honorific. Do not worry, he knows your name." Upon hearing this news, the king's face went red. The strange ways of the Japanese would take some effort to learn."

The taps of his cane echoed as he walked to his office at a speed that even a snail would find wanting. His daughter Lydia accompanied him, trying her level best to match the King's sluggish pace. "Are you sure you don't need help, father?" There was genuine concern in the princess' voice.\n\n"I'm fine, Lydia." Rurik sighed. "It's days like these that remind me I'm not long for this world..."\n\n"Do not say that, father. You know I don't like it when you talk of your own mortality."\n\n"I'm sorry, Lydia. It's just... there is so much left to do. To die would be to abandon my duties."\n\n"I think you've accomplished quite enough already. What we have achieved so far is nothing short of extraordinary, and it couldn't have been done without you. Asking any more would be unreasonable."\n\nRurik stopped and turned to his daughter, grasping her hands. "Lydia, tell me, will my realm be in good hands?"\n\nLydia met her father's gaze, not a hint of doubt in her eyes. "There is not a single person in this kingdom who cares for it like you and I do.""
