 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC:0 "Еще во времена старого Советского Союза Генрих Григорьевич Ягода был человеком, которого многие знали и боялись. Будучи главой НКВД, Ягода отвечал за укрепление стабильности и безопасности режима Бухарина, которого он поддерживал с самого начала борьбы за власть, приведшей его к такому высокому посту. По его простому приказу даже самый знаменитый большевик мог внезапно исчезнуть или быть казнен за контрреволюционную деятельность.\n\nЗатем, когда началась война, большая часть Союза, включая саму Москву, пала под немецким сапогом. В последовавшем хаосе Ягода использовал доверенную ему власть, чтобы эвакуировать большую часть Президиума Верховного Совета на восток, как можно дальше от Рейха. В конце концов ему удалось установить контроль над территорией в глубинах Сибири. Оттуда он и управлял одним из самых могущественных государств-преемников Советского Союза.\n\n Однако государство, которое построил старый Президиум, просуществовало недолго. Снова и снова враги и предатели нападали на свои собственные вотчины, и империя Ягоды медленно, но верно, рушилась. Отделиться хотели все: от ненавистных реакционеров из Харбина до "демократов" Центральной Сибири и ее генералов, до предательских ревизионистов по ту сторону Байкала. И все же, несмотря на все удары, нанесенные Иркутскому правительству, оно по-прежнему остается на плаву, хоть теперь и как еще одна военная клика на просторах России. Однако то, что выгодно отличает ее от других - законность: ни один другой военачальник не может претендовать на это, ведь режим Ягоды является прямым преемником старого правительства. Ягода теперь контролирует регион Иркутска, где НКВД несет ответственность за защиту последнего оплота революции, и только горстка бухаринских политиков может управлять страной. Это все, что осталось у Ягоды, но уж поверьте - этого будет достаточно"

 IRK_mutiny_the_response_desc:0 "Товарищи! Братья и сестры! Рабочие и крестьяне Иркутской области! От имени Президиума СССР мы просим вас оставаться бдительными, ибо само существование нашей советской Родины находится под угрозой. Воспользовавшись нашей уязвимостью, когда мы сражались с силами Родзаевского и Пастернака,  дезертиры и предатели под руководством Валерия Саблина пытаются организовать антисоветское восстание, поднимая тёмные и необразованные массы под своё знамя, насильно заставляя их творить невообразимые преступления против рабочего народа.\n\nЭто восстание – испытание, от которого зависит наше выживание. Мы просим вас не поддаваться на провокации саблинцев-контрреволюционеров и направить все свои силы на борьбу с внутренним врагом. Мы предупреждаем, что Советская власть не будет милосердна к предателям. Все, кто будут уличены в антисоветской деятельности или будут поддерживать восставших будут привлечены к ответственности и подвергнутся суровому наказанию."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_trenches_desc:0 "The Soldiers of the Union have endured the unimaginable, and we must now ask them to endure more. They are our shield against the traitors and partisans who seek to finish what the Germans started all those years ago. If the Union is to survive, we have to do everything we can to support the men fighting on the front line for our cause.\n\nBy ensuring deliveries of food, equipment, and weapons reliably make it on time to the soldiers who need them we can make the hellish conditions of Siberian warfare slightly more bearable. We can cycle between frontline and reserve duty, allowing them to recover and fight more effectively when it is time to return to the battlefield. We cannot let our morale falter in the face of yet another threat."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_defense_desc:0 "The partisan's rebellion must be quickly crushed without mercy or hesitation. To this effect, Yagoda has ordered the Ministry of Defense to immediately shift the nation to a war footing until the eastern rebellion has been fully stamped out. Certain areas of the economy will shift production to military materials, while others will continue to operate, but in a modified fashion. Military rations will be temporarily prioritized over the civilian food supply, while several factories currently producing civilian goods will begin being converted to weapon foundries.\n\nAnother step the Ministry of Defense has been ordered to take is the issuing of the "museum pieces". These antiquated weapons date back to before the second world war and have until now been kept in storage. The Ministry will issue these weapons to our reserve units focused on hunting partisans operating in our own territory."
 IRK_mutiny_volunteers_for_the_union_desc:0 "Добровольцы для Союза"
 IRK_mutiny_nkvd_guards_detachments_desc:0 "In the Union's darkest hour, it was the NKVD that rescued the presidium and escorted it to Irkutsk. Now, when we are forced to fight for our survival once more, the NKVD shall deliver us victory again. Some of the most experienced soldiers in our nation are members of the NKVD guards. Currently, these men are scattered in small groups across the country, serving as bodyguards, intelligence officers, and secret police, but they could be of greater use if we organized them into a full military division.\n\nThis new NKVD motor rifle division will be the tip of the spear that we will skewer the traitors with. The ragtag bandits won't stand a chance against the discipline and ruthlessness of the finest soldiers of the Soviet Union. Once we have defeated the partisans this new division will be instrumental to our reclamation of Siberia, and eventually all of Russia."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_construction_desc:0 "Irkutsk is the main economic and industrial hub of eastern Siberia, but we have been hurt by the rebellion. Large portions of our military industry and infrastructure have fallen under the control of Sablin's bandits at a moment when we need them most. To make up for this, the Directorate of Construction will have to make some accommodations for our military.\n\nFactory space that would have otherwise gone to other projects has been cleared for military production. Infrastructure projects that will benefit the military have been accelerated while civilian constructions have been postponed indefinitely. Until we have recovered our stolen industry, we must get everything we have out of what remains. We have to keep our army supplied and on the move, no matter the cost."
 IRK_mutiny_field_fortification_planning_desc:0 "Планирование полевых фортификаций"
 IRK_mutiny_supplemental_labor_battalions_desc:0 "We need all hands on deck to defeat the Sablinites, even those who might have failed us before. The gulags of our nation are filled with physically capable prisoners eager to prove their redemption and earn their freedom, or at the very least a reduced sentence. We will create a program of labor battalions formed from volunteers from the gulags, who will supplement our military engineers and aid field constructions for the duration of the rebellion.\n\nOf course, we must be careful with these volunteers. Many of them have attempted to betray us before, and exposure to any rebel propaganda could easily incite them to do so again. To incentivize loyalty, any volunteers who complete their work without incident will be rewarded with a modest reduction of their sentence. The last thing we want is a mass prisoner revolt behind our lines."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_capital_desc:0 "Sablin's rebellion has exposed the key weaknesses within our central government. It is a travesty that the traitors managed to advance their cause to this point without the institutions of the state managing to stamp them out. Immediate steps must be taken to make sure that the holes in the government that led to the present situation are plugged.\n\nOnce the partisans have been crushed the government must be ready to quickly reintegrate the territory they stole from us and crack down on any remaining dissent that may emerge. We must also begin a review of our government to see how this rebellion escaped our notice. This will not be allowed to happen again, not if the Union is to have any hope of surviving."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_presidium_desc:0 "The necessary reforms to our apparatus of the state will be handled by the Presidium of the Soviet Union. In these troubled times the Presidium can serve as a beacon of stability to guide us through the storm. While the military and the NKVD handle the matter of crushing the rebellion, the politicians of the Presidium will work to make sure that normalcy is maintained as much as is possible in a time of war.\n\nInvestigations into the Presidium itself must also take place, both internal and external. If any traitors remain hidden within our government we must sniff them out. More important than that though, is the lack of oversight within the Presidium that allowed the rebellion's leaders to continue their plot. In the new Presidium such things will not be possible."
 IRK_mutiny_an_ironclad_union_desc:0 "This is no time for dissenting voices or questioning authority. The Union is facing a crisis that threatens to destroy it, a crisis which was born out of disunity. Some within our government see the rebellion as a chance to advance their own agendas or push for their pet reforms while our attention is elsewhere. If this backroom maneuvering is allowed to go on unchecked it could spell our demise.\n\nYagoda has ordered that all factionalism within the Presidium and the government as a whole must end immediately. For the duration of the crisis only authorized motions pertaining to it may be discussed and implemented. Anyone who attempts to subvert this order will find just how serious we are. There may eventually be a day when we can afford the luxury of allowing constructive criticism from within our ranks. That day is not today."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_shadows_desc:0 "The greatest weapon left in our arsenal is our intelligence apparatus. When Russia fractured it was the agents of the NKVD who kept the Union alive and carved out a new home for the revolution in Irkutsk. The operatives and spies of the NKVD are some of the most experienced in the world. The time has come to use them against Sablin and his gang of traitors, and tear apart the upstart rebellion from within.\n\nThe fragile new government across lake Baikal is a perfect target for infiltration and sabotage. It is run by inexperienced amateurs trying to figure out how to run a nation as they go. Our agents will have no trouble infiltrating it by posing as traitors or double agents, and in many cases, they won't even need to hide their identities. Before long the partisans will be in disarray, with all their plans and secrets laid bare before us."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_state_security_desc:0 "When one is waging a war of subterfuge and espionage, defense is even more critical than offense. As we uncover the secrets of the rebellion, we must take precautions to make sure they do not uncover ours as well. The NKVD's internal service apparatus, the Directorate of State Security is responsible for this vital mission. Partisan operations are notoriously hard to stamp out, but if there is anyone who can do it, it is them.\n\nMembers of the government who display anything less than total loyalty will be placed under surveillance, as will anyone who was associated with known traitors before they began their revolt. Agents will be posted in every town and city, keeping their ears to the ground for any sign of trouble. Patrols will sweep the countryside to intercept infiltrators. Irkutsk shall become an intelligence black hole."
 IRK_mutiny_mobile_interrogation_centers_desc:0 "Sometimes time is of the essence and prisoners with valuable information cannot be transported back to secure locations quickly enough. Extracting information is already a time-consuming process without the added delay of bringing a captured asset to an interrogation room and then having to take the information they divulge back to the front lines. The solution to this problem is simple: bring the interrogation room to the front lines.\n\nBy refitting a number of trucks to carry intelligence officers who specialize in information extraction and "wetwork", as well as the tools they use to carry out their jobs, we can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of our interrogations of sablinite prisoners. As an added bonus, the trucks may acquire such a reputation that the unpleasant methods of our interrogators may be rendered unnecessary. The fear of the trucks alone will break even the most hardened partisan."
 IRK_mutiny_trials_fitting_for_traitors_desc:0 "Суды, достойные предателей"
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0 "In times of war propaganda can make the difference between victory and defeat. It is essential that friendly morale be kept high and enemy morale be kept low. The current rebellion is no exception and the Ministry of Propaganda has been hard at work making sure everyone knows that our victory is inevitable. They have recently completed the preparations for a two-pronged propaganda offensive for soldiers on both sides of the front line.\n\nWe will inspire our own loyal soldiers with tales of bravery performed by their comrades, and by reminding them of the long legacy of resistance and heroism they are continuing. We will bombard the traitorous bandits with propaganda proving the superiority of our troops and exposing the misguided fools they have followed into battle against their own countrymen."
 IRK_mutiny_remember_the_revolution_desc:0 "Sablin has attempted to claim the mantle of Lenin's revolution, painting himself as a true Leninist and his band of scum as spiritual successors to the October Revolution. While this is obviously nonsense, many of our citizens have fallen under the sway of these lies. We must prove that we carry the torch of the worker's revolution, while the partisans are nothing more than deceitful reactionaries.\n\nThe Ministry of Propaganda will launch a campaign based on Sablin's messages - remembering the October Revolution, staying true to Lenin's goals, ect., but we will do it better. Sablin is stuck with a group of ideologues and intellectuals quoting theory at each other, while we have teams of professional propagandists working with a proper budget to spread our messages far and wide."
 IRK_mutiny_for_it_forever_lives_on_desc:0 "Её бесмертное наследие"
 IRK_mutiny_the_union_forever_desc:0 "Victory is at hand. After months of fighting we have finally driven back the traitors and are preparing to deliver the killing blow. These cowards sought to destroy the Union when it was at its weakest, but they failed to learn the lessons of history. If the Germans with the mightiest army to ever march across Europe could not destroy us, no one can. They knew their only chance was to strike while our back was turned and even then they failed.\n\nOnce our victory has been secured it will be time to begin rebuilding our fractured territory. This hopeless rebellion never had a chance of toppling the Soviet Union, but it will change it. Certainly we cannot revert to the old status quo that allowed this to happen in the first place. We will never be able to reclaim Russia if we are constantly occupied fighting rebellions and partisans. No matter what happens, we will go forward knowing our victory is assured. The Union shall not, must not fall."

 IRK_postwar_the_union_victorious_desc:0 "The people of the Soviet Union have done it, comrades! The rebellious Sablinites have been utterly smashed and we have emerged victorious from the battle in full glory! We have proven our strength once more and showing our neighbors that we will not go down without a fight.\n\nHowever, just because the battle has been finished, does not mean that this is time for celebration! It is time for us to regroup and bring justice to the Sablinites!\n\nIt is time for the Soviet Union to cut the final piece of thread that our opposition dangles off of, and to show the Sablinites that we, the people of the Union, still remain vigilant and powerful, even in our most dire state!"
 IRK_postwar_the_great_purge_desc:0 "The Soviet Union can not allow these revolts to ever occur again! If Russia is to ever rise from the ashes and show the Union as a stable entity, then our regional administrations must not allow these rebels to ever rise up against our government. We need to strike the source of the problem: The Incompetent and Corrupt.\n\nIt is time for a Purge, we must round up all those that are too incompetent to lead an administration, gather them all up! Fire them! Imprison them! Expel them from the party!\n\nAnd for the especially corrupt, bring them to the back of the shed and shoot them like the sick dogs they are! We cannot have a stable Union if the people are being represented so incompetently..."
 IRK_postwar_assemble_the_commission_desc:0 "It is crucial that we have an effective Purge to remove the filth, and in doing so, we will need an effective Commission that can do the work of collecting the information of these incompetent and corrupt officials, then disposing of them through however means absolutely all means necessary.\n\nWe must bring the people within the NKVD that are talented at handling and sorting through the evidence we find about the corrupt administrators and plotting how to deal with them, depending on just how severe they might destroy this Union from the inside out.\n\nAfter all, it would be impossible to commit to our Purge without an actual Commission to handle the dirty work for the people of the Soviet Union, we cannot risk another rebellion!"
 IRK_postwar_recall_suspect_personnel_desc:0 "We have a lot of suspects noted by the NKVD for potential punishment, whether their track record are a lot more minor cases of simply sheer incompetence, or more extreme cases of corruption, we will need to remove them from their positions for the necessary steps of the Purge.\n\nHowever, while the people we are purging might have been incompetent at their job or might have had traces of corruption, we cannot just remove them from their positions and leave an empty void. Those positions will need to be filled.\n\nWe will instate some... "temporary" personnel to fill their shoes in their jobs, we cannot leave such a power gap or else we could be destabilizing the Union further."
 IRK_postwar_the_investigations_desc:0 "While nobody can remain out of the NKVD's grasp for long, it has become clear that some of the suspects we are closing in on are simply entrenched too deep into the political machine to be removed easily. Now that the commission has been assembled, we shall begin a wide series of investigations to gather evidence on those corrupt officials who foolishly assume they are untouchable. With luck, we will find something concrete and can continue to make arrests.\n\nOnce we have enough material on to start the crackdowns in earnest, however, the question remains as to how to properly deal with the arrested officials. With the evidence in hand, the commission will move to determine the severity of the suspect's crimes, and therefore the severity of their punishment.\n\nWhile most of these parasites will no doubt be found to be enemies of the state and will be purged for their idiotic crimes against the people, there may be some who are not too far gone and can be encouraged to realize the error of their ways. Once the evidence has been gathered and reviewed, the final decision on whether or not to show clemency with minor offenders will ultimately rest on Comrade Yagoda and the NKVD."
 IRK_postwar_zero_tolerance_desc:0 "These incompetent and corrupt officials can not be allowed to continue holding their governmental positions in any capacity! Any person who is caught and prosecuted within the Great Purge will not be reinstated in any capacity in our government, no matter how little their job!\n\nWe are to show absolutely no mercy to these people, when the Great Purge is over and should they be spared, they must be forbidden from re-entering the political scene in the Soviet Union ever again! The damage they caused while they were in power was already bad enough, if we let them back on, imagine how much more damage they could do to the people!\n\nThe Soviet Union cannot risk these disgusting incompetents crawling their way back onto the administration, or else they could destroy the Union!"
 IRK_postwar_opportunities_for_forgiveness_desc:0 "There are a certain group of people within our reach that we could potentially use to our advantage in order to further re-establish our glorious republic. Their role in the prior administration was highly effective, but all that effectiveness ended up coming at a price - corruption.\n\nThe opportunity for us is there to seize; the major potential to gain us the return of those who had powerful projection of their skills in our government.\n\nIf we are to utilise these people to our advantage, we could promise them redemption. They could regain their original positions and we can cover their tracks, however, only under the stern condition that they do not repeat their... silly mistakes once more."
 IRK_postwar_the_irkutsk_trials_desc:0 "The Irkutsk Trials"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_the_mutiny_desc:0 "The Buryat Mutiny, the disgraceful Sablinite rebellion against the Soviet Union, while their ideology was in the wrong place and they were promptly crushed by the real Revolution they sought to revolt against, perhaps we should take some notes of their tactical ability against us.\n\nThe ability for the rebels to arm so many supporters is a curious one, and one we should be opening commissions into. We need to analyse how they were able to achieve what they had managed to, and see how we can adopt that to the Soviet Union's army!\n\nWhile the Sablinites might not have been good at using their tactics effectively, the Soviet Union will happily rebrand it as ours and use it more efficiently!"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_their_spirit_desc:0 "What was the driving force behind their rebellion, comrades? It was their hope and desires to remove our administration for their own potential regime, which had ended up creating quite the inspirational source for them to gain the ideas of toppling the Union.\n\nWe must take some notes from what gave the rebellious Sablinites the hope to take over, and note what we could gain from learning how they had formed their desire to replace the Soviet Union with their flawed system.\n\nIf we can ignite that same light of patriotism, not for Sablin, but rather for the people of Russia within the Union, then we have much to gain from this, comrades."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_sablin_desc:0 "While Sablin did their absolutely disgraceful betrayal of what the Soviet Union has stood for, it could be in our key interest to investigate Sablinite policies and check for the outliers that could help control our land further.\n\nIt could be necessary that we implement some minor reforms that have come from Sablin's system, to not only increase our popularity from his former supporters, but to potentially have our very own benefits to taking these ideas for ourselves.\n\nThere might not be anything wrong taking ideas from a betrayal if those ideas are indeed beneficial for our own gain...isn't there?"
 IRK_postwar_rebuilding_our_legitimacy_desc:0 "The great and powerful Soviet Union has been shattered and we have all but disintegrated on the world stage - this is a catastrophe for every person within the Union.\n\nWe have been torn apart from the inside ever since the German invasion of our Union, falling apart piece by piece, until we have been diminished to our current state. But we won't give up so easily with such a set back. In order to accomplish our goals, our government's legitimacy must be restored, back to when we were truly recognized as the leaders of Russia!\n\nNo matter the means that we are to take our approach for the reclamation of the Union, we must regain our spot among the great powers once more and return the people of Russia to their rightful place on the world stage!"
 IRK_postwar_a_union_of_letters_desc:0 "Since the fall of our union decades ago, opportunists, counter-revolutionaries, and fools alike have fought an unceasing war to destroy our legitimacy.The Sablinite rebellion was the last in a long line of betrayals and traitorous acts, each designed to lead the masses astray towards their own inevitable destruction.\n\nAfter so many brushes with annihilation, many in the presidium believe it is high time to turn inward. While we have always acted with their best interests at heart, It is clear that much of our population has lost faith in their government's ability to uphold the ideals of the revolution and provide for them.\n\nIn light of this, and in an attempt to expedite reintegration of the Buryat ASSR, we will begin a new campaign, one of "1000 letters".\n\nNamed after the 17th century "republic of letters", we will attempt to foster a similar culture of innovation. Open criticism in all levels of government will be encouraged, so long as it is constructive. Workers and Bureaucrats alike will be asked to mail in their thoughts and concerns regarding our reunification struggle.\n\nHopefully such actions will lead to an efficient administration, attraction of distant intellectuals, and a renewed sense of connection between the masses and their vanguard party."
 IRK_postwar_necessary_reforms_desc:0 "The 1000 Letters campaign has proven to be exceptionally fruitful! Peasants and Bureaucrats alike have risen to the occasion, making use of this unique opportunity for critical expression directed to the presidium itself. We have received well over 1000 letters, each detailing workplace grievances and various administrative inefficiencies.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most encouraging result of our effort has been the expansion of legitimacy among the formerly rebellious Buryat ASSR. While it is true that the eastern shores of Lake Baikal were relatively timid in composing letters, those that we have collected have proven highly valuable. In addition, the lack of a crackdown upon those that spoke freely seems to have eased tensions. Acts of sabotage are steadily declining, and it appears we just might be able to deprogram those taken hostage by opportunism yet.\n\nNow comes the time of transformation. From words we have devised actions; Increases in low level pay,a tempered five year grain quota, and the closing of managerial loopholes. These programs, as well as other collected reforms, will soon be implemented to compound upon the trust we have built. Let us make haste."

In order to achieve this goal, only the most educated and politically advanced people can run the higher functions of the state, not the average worker. To directly involve the people could risk needless inefficiency at a critical time, especially as we reorganize the Union.

An open showing of security will force the criminals to retreat underground, and allow us to reassert our authority.

Speeches shall be conducted and propaganda to this end will be spread across our lands, but we must ensure that these are not empty words by actually supporting the people. It may be costly, but it will help us gain a sense of legitimacy, something that we need now more than ever."

Furthermore, we must ensure the people understand that the Presidium, and Yagoda, do not exist just to be a distant ruler, but to ensure your safety and security in a time when that is all too rare. By increasing the rate of patrols throughout the cities, and having an increased presence of security in the countryside, we can hopefully express that yes, we will keep the people safe!"

Once the east is secured with our righteous fervor and might, we shall move deeper and deeper into our lost heartland, and drive the traitors who abandoned the Union back, either into retreat or into the ground. With the spirited guidance of the legitimate leader of the Union, Comrade Yagoda, our failure in the brutal conflicts to come is a near impossibility.

These are people who idealize the very system that brought our proud Union to its knees. This indignity cannot be allowed to stand. Through iron and fire we will show them that we are strong, that we have always been strong. From here to Kamchatka, our beloved socialist ideals will cause the hearts of the proletariat so wrongfully suppressed by the Fascists or the false Tsar to soar for the first time in years.

That sentiment including themselves. An envoy should be sent with a message suggesting that the partisans acknowledge our claim over their lands and their citizens in return for friendship and a part in restoring the glory of the Union.

Every citizen of our Union that is beaten, robbed, or killed is a serious insult to every member of the Soviet Union. Our priority now that Aldan has been turned into an ally of the Union should be to transform the area into a veritable fortress against the northern wolves who might make victims of our citizenry. With enough men, guns, and concrete we can make sure that an assault from our north would be a fool's errand. Hopefully, with enough time and resistance to their excursions into our newly reclaimed territory, we may prove that they are fruitless efforts and stop them altogether."

Even if the citizens themselves do not believe in the necessity of these steps, we will show them the necessity with our own force of arms. After this, the citizens will be sure to support us as their hearts cry out to live under the banner of socialism once more whether they realize it or not.

The trials are a show, but a necessary one. Their cases are a coming storm that will shake the resolve of the less committed among us, but the strength and righteousness of our cause will be maintained through the silencing of their voices. No one may be allowed to subvert the truth of our cause with their rebellion, and an example must be made of those who would. A cacophony of gunshots ring through Irkutsk tonight.

Instrumental in holding back the spread of these movements and their ideals throughout Irkutsk has been the NKVD, ever watchful over the safety of our citizens and the revolutionary movement in their steadfast vigilance.\n\nHowever, as we spread our movement and reclaim what once was, some have begun to suggest dangerous ideals, such as that we lift these restrictions on culture and allow our people to freely express themselves. This is simply preposterous! We see again and again the results of an unguarded populace - the creation of reactionary regimes that have enslaved Mother Russia! We cannot allow this to take root in our nation. Instead, movies will be reviewed before showings, newspaper articles will be heavily censored, and only art deemed appropriate may be put before the public's eyes. Onwards!"

Now, with the USSR united politically and his preeminent rivals in ditches or the gulag, it is time for the dominant Yagoda to enact his philosophy, the Yagodaschina.\n\nTo epitomize Yagoda's beliefs in one word would be order.

This was more than proven when thousands deserted the Union for that traitor Sablin. We must rip out this tumor from the ranks of the single most important organ of our administration and ensure it is unable to grow any stronger, preventing it from endangering the safety of our nation once again.\n\nTo be attacked are the issues of corruption and bureaucratic excess that have held back the NKVD from reaching the heights that we desire. A secret subcommittee is to be created to explore corruption, locating those who skim money off the top and target their political rivals. Lists of these individuals are to be sent to Yagoda for approval of their removal as part of the most recent purge. A separate subcommittee has been approved to investigate the issue of overwhelming bureaucracy, one that Yagoda firmly believes is paralyzing its effectiveness.

This has the two-fold effect of increasing loyalty as well as strengthening the security apparatus and expanding its reach.\n\nWhile rewards are given, it is important to ensure that previous issues with corruption are dodged, and so the subcommittee investigating corruption is to be maintained to ensure the integrity of the NKVD, and in turn, the security of the true successor to the Union."

He consistently shows an ability to organize the inner workings of the Union. His dedicated work is an example to all those who have the honor of offering their time in the support of the new Russian civil administration, and so he has been elevated to the head of the movement.

A silent, bloodless revolution was under way that would return the Soviet Union to Lenin's founding vision.\n\nWith their power now secure, the Presidium has drafted a bold set of new reforms to be implemented.

Bukharin let the Union grow weak and failed to defend it when the Germans invaded. After Yagoda seized power the problems only worsened. He reduced the Union to nothing more than an NKVD client state that paid lip service to the revolution and nothing else.\n\nIt is far past time we returned to the original course Lenin set for us. There must be a true dictatorship of the proletariat, not simply a bourgeois dictatorship dressed in red. The liberation of the working class must always be at the forefront of our minds.

We can begin relegating them to unimportant duties where they will be unable to obstruct our work. Many of our most talented bureaucrats and government workers are members of the State faction. The loss of their skills and experience will be something of a setback, but we cannot afford to have counterrevolutionaries sabotaging our government from within.

It is no surprise that the Nomenklatura are almost universally supporters of the State faction that would preserve the status quo they thrive in.\n\nIf we want to call ourselves a real revolutionary government, we have to put an end to this new bourgeoisie.

Even as the NKVD-friendly state faction declines into irrelevance, many of the administrative structures and loopholes they put in place for Yagoda's henchmen remain.\n\nIf we eliminated these loopholes, it would go a long way towards relegating the NKVD back to its original purpose: protecting the revolutionary state, not controlling it. Reducing the NKVD's role in the government would also ease the administrative burden we are currently grappling with.

During the reign of the NKVD the number of people sent to the gulags greatly increased, and many of those imprisonments were not justified. Men and women who were proud revolutionaries and dedicated members of the Communist party were imprisoned simply for questioning Yagoda and his allies. We must correct this.\n\nThe files of every political prisoner must be reviewed to see which ones are suitable for release.

While the Communist party is the vanguard of the revolution and must always maintain control over the revolutionary state, a form of limited democracy within the party can be allowed.\n\nUnder this new system we will allow party members who have worked within the government for a minimum of 4 years and are found to be in good political and moral standing to vote on various matters. Of course, only communists will be allowed to vote and run for office, but even a limited form of democracy will prove to the people that we are not just another despotic government."

The dominant economies of the world are approaching a new model largely oriented towards the service sector and the integration of recent technological development into praxis.\n\nWhat this means for us, simply speaking, is we need to catch up with the rest of the world. While some plans for rapid modernization have been outlined, it has been decided that the matter should rather be approached cautiously.

It has been described as a set of conceptual principles that pragmatically amalgamates major aspects of Lenin's and Bukharin's economic theories with Yagoda's own thesis.

This would allow us to selectively loosen restrictions for foreign trade and investment, without compromising on greater national trade policies, while still bringing foreign capital to work developing our backward regions.\n\nConveniently, the region that would benefit most from this is the Pacific Coast with the zones there drawn around the urban ports, already promising centers of international trade."

It was largely a backwater peripheral region in the days of the empire and was often underinvested into even by Lenin's administration. Comrade Bukharin did have plans for renovating its economy as part of the Siberian Plan, but they, regrettably, came to pass only partially, as the union was ultimately shattered.\n\nThis centuries' worth of neglect's consequences are most prevalent in the transport sector of the economy. It has been, in fact, determined, that the regional industrial potential's greatest limit is the capabilities of the infrastructure, which are, even in the best cases, below satisfactory.

As the policy is nominally a temporary measure, it deters them from investing, fearing they would lose the funds when the transition to a fully state-controlled socialist model comes in the future.

Unfortunately, as the dominant power in Asia, their empire theoretically enjoys a degree of influence and might far above the Union's.\n\nHowever, in actuality, the Sphere is a crumbling structure, built to inspire awe, but not to last. Recent developments have shown, that its diplomatic alienation deprived it of developed trading partners, which in combination with bureaucratic incompetence has significantly damaged the Sphere's economic potential, to the point where we can directly compete with them on the international stage.\n\nBy putting our efforts towards actively toppling Japan from its seat of economic power in Asia we can both benefit from replacing that position ourselves, and undermine one of our most dangerous regional competitors.

While the roots of this lie in Japan pumping resources and capital into its puppet state, their management of such resources presents a curious case.\n\nWhile retaining the core tenets of fascist state-monopolistic capitalism, the 'Manchurian Model' as it came to be known largely managed to avoid bureaucratic stagnation through rationalization of management, which allowed for the state to exercise its powers for the optimization of the wartime economy.

Fortunately, this crude transport hub can be repurposed into a proper trading port and shipbuilding facility.\n\nWhile the ports of Magadan and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky could fulfill the task already, they are poorly connected with the regional center. Additionally, sub-optimal climate may render them unusable over the cold period of the year.

However, with the relocation to Siberia, we lost much expertise, and now is the first time we find our industry capable of rearming the air force up to modern standards.\n\nWhile the production base is already capable of producing airplanes, the main challenge we are posed with is the lack of technological insight. To remedy this, a curious proposal has been made by a group of theorists.

One more ambitious proposal is to revive the Machine-Tractor Stations - local enterprises for ownership and maintenance of agricultural machinery, established in the late 1920s.

Fortunately, the Union's economists have found a compromise solution. It calls for a complex system that ensures import contracts are scaled in accordance with the fulfillment of the economic plan. This policy, if streamlined properly, will encourage domestic production of goods that would otherwise be imported without devolving into outright autarky."

Many of its buildings are not up to present standards, its streets unoptimized for modern traffic movement, its universities, and industries archaic and obstructing the greater economic plans we have for the region.\n\nIt seems, that much like its namesake in 1853, The Paris of Siberia will require a series of renovations to become a modern urban center.

Thus it has been found necessary to start constructing a new branch of the TransSib, going North, along the Pacific coast. While extending a railway through the depths of Siberia is no easy task, and some are already dubbing it 'The Construction Project of the Century' due to the difficulties of the initiative, the task itself should be relatively simple to achieve."

It has thus been found detrimental, that in the spirit of proletarian egalitarianism, potential intellectuals of all sexes, nationalities, and backgrounds should be provided the necessary education and resources to conduct research for the benefit of the Union. If we are to achieve this, first we must direct our efforts towards eliminating the few remaining prejudices of the education system.

So strong is the NKVD's sense of purpose that it even preoccupies itself with responsibilities beyond its charter, like supplementing the Red Army's equipment and manpower with its own.\n\nIt would be remiss of us not to acknowledge their loyalty simply because our situation has improved. Hence, the Presidium of the Soviet Union has decreed the formalization of the NKVD's de facto status as a separate branch of the Soviet Armed Forces.

Or when signals equipment were worth their weight in gold for how few remained after years of combat losses and neglect.\n\nThese conditions have changed - and not necessarily for the better.

And when the Red Army's heavier assets - tanks, helicopters, artillery - either stayed behind in the Urals or defected during the Siberian War, its planners utilized trucks with small arms to great extents. Shifting circumstances, after all, warrant a shift in priorities.\n\nNow the Soviet Union has regained much of the factories it had lost.

The oppressors of this world will quake in fear when they hear of this new alliance. They have fought so hard to divide us, for they know that together we are stronger than them. A new day is dawning."

 IRK.1.t:0 "Наследие союза"
 IRK.1.desc:0 "The young child carelessly wandered the rooms of the house as always, noticing even the tiniest detail. After hours of exploration, he came across a small chest. Inside it, one could find a grand collection of glamorous medals, photos and documents. The boy turned to his father and asked him what these were. "Some old things from the days of glory", he said. One item had caught his attention, though: a shiny red-and-gold medal. "This is the Order of Lenin", answered the father before the boy could even open his mouth.\n\n"Who is this Lenin?" the child asked innocently. The NKVD guard preparing to take the official to the Presidium looked at him and could not help but smile.\n\n"A great man. Perhaps, if he was still alive, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. Wars, deaths, the oppression of the masses - it could have all been avoided. You need to remember, son, that it is up to us to continue his legacy. Before you were born, the true government of the motherland fell to the invader in Moscow, but we, the members of the Presidium, saved it with the help of Comrade Yagoda and his friends, and fled to Irkutsk."\n\n"Why are all these awful things happening, then? Why can't we live a normal life?"\n\n"The story of how we got here is not a simple one, but you must learn it. First, the Germans came: with their tanks and their bombs, they invaded the motherland and enslaved millions, ending Bukharin's rule. Then came the bourgeoisie, the "intellectuals" and the rich who fought us when we were in dire straits, and ended the chances of reclaiming the nation with the Siberian War. Next were the reactionaries, the Japanese puppets who came from the west instead. And the final blow were the revisionists, the Sablinite mutineers across the lake. We are the only ones left to continue the Union."\n\n"So, these four caused all of this?""

 IRK.2.desc:0 "In a room full of shifting politicians and hushed mutters, Bulanov remained totally silent. Hunched over a radio, he listened intently.-much was at stake.\n\nAlmost 200 kilometers away, a group of men traveled equally silently. Hugging the shores of the moonlit lake, they stalked towards their target. No more than 15 in number, they resembled a flock of birds, each taking his place in a winged formation.\n\nWith the building in sight, their commander raised his fist. The men split into teams, each stepping over the roadside concrete divider. The teams approached the small concrete outpost from opposite sides.\n\nThe first floor was by all accounts effortless. Hardened veterans of the NKVD were more than a match for some sleeping partisans. Knives tore through the sleeping dissidents as if they were pillows. The only sounds to be heard were brief, whimpered cries.\n\nTwo shots was all it took to finish the men who lurked up the staircase, killed in unison as they came to investigate what sounded like a commotion. It was only upon reaching the top of the complex that trouble came. Big walloping booms descended upon the assailants, the product of an American remington.\n\nTwo less then they were before, the NKVD operatives had finally reached their target. He fumbled for his gun, perhaps to kill himself, perhaps to fight off the inevitable. Regardless, he was swiftly descended upon.\n\n"Package secured."\n\nBulanov straightened himself, turned off the radio, and exited silently."

 IRK.3.t:0 "Натиск пропаганды"
 IRK.3.desc:0 "It was anything but funny, and yet Gurevich could hardly contain his laughter.\n\nIt had all happened so fast. One moment he sat in his dilapidated steel chair, enjoying a precious commodity he had secretly uncovered; a cigarette. Next he found himself prone, his body hypnotized in muscle memory forged by remnants of Luftwaffe terrorism in the war.\n\nThis time however, no distant booms accompanied the sound of engines. Simply a soft whoosh, and then silence.As the others slowly uncoiled themselves from fetal positions and emerged from the various shacks they had cowered in, they stared at their commanding officer, who was now hysterical.\n\n"Pamphlets!" he shouted through bouts of absurd laughter. "The bastards have sent us reading material!"\n\nThe quiet tension broke as the people milled about the courtyard again. Some cried, having felt yet another brush with the end. Others returned to their duties, long used to such close calls.\n\nGurevich shuffled through the wet paper at his feet before picking one up to examine. A few others did the same.\n\n"The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is prepared to grant amnesty to any persons who renounce this so called "Sablinite" rebellion. We, the Presidium urge individuals who possess pertinent information and a sense of patriotism to travel to the city of Irkutsk. Failure to comply with this directive will be viewed as a traitorous action against the people and the motherland, and prosecuted to the fullest extent."\n\nGurevich crumpled the paper in his hands and stormed off towards the nearest building to convene with Sablin. It was now apparent that not even the skies themselves were safe from NKVD indoctrination."
 IRK.3.a:0 ""We must hope you will heed our message...""

 IRK.4.t:0 "Похищенные офицеры!"
 IRK.4.desc:0 "Colonel Popov stared down at the stained and outdated map that laid before him, trying to sort this mess out. Ever since his defection from the NKVD, he had been trying his best to lend his talents to the mutineers and show them how a war is supposed to be fought. Perhaps it wouldn't have been such a challenge if they weren't young enough to be Popov's children. Getting these youngsters to work with any kind of cohesion has proved to be more difficult than the colonel had ever expected.\n\n"What are we waiting for? The tyrant's goons lie in wait just beyond that ridge! I say to hell with all of this, we should head over there and kick some ass!" A spirited young officer said, trying to win over the cramped room with his bluster. Popov found himself getting ready to respond, but a muffled noise from outside distracted him from the moment. Glancing at the window, all he could see was the furious Siberian winter continuing its assault on the glass panes. Perhaps it was just the wind? "And what is your plan once we get over there," one of the other officers asked, "charge into their lines and die like idiots?" Popov heard it again, and this time it was closer. The howling wind made it difficult to determine what it was. "Well, we have to do something! I've been freezing my-" The brash young officer was cut off by the sound of the door being violently kicked open.\n\nPopov felt his heart leap out of his chest as he turned his attention to the door. Four imposing figures wearing white camouflage coats and brandishing assault rifles began loudly demanding everyone in the room to surrender their arms. His heart sank as he recognized the badges on their hats. The NKVD had come for him. "I'll never surrender, you bastards!" the young officer boldly shouted at the assailants as he drew his sidearm. He scarcely had the chance to aim before the soldiers unleashed a vicious storm of lead, gunning down every man in the room besides Popov. Ears ringing and vision blurred by the blood of his comrades, the disoriented colonel felt his knees give in. The last thing he remembered seeing that night was the attackers' shadows looming closer and closer."
 IRK.4.a:0 "Damn them!"

 IRK.5.t:0 "Putting Down The Traitors"
 IRK.5.desc:0 "The past decades have been an unrelenting disaster for true patriots of the motherland. Revolutionary morals; values paid for dearly in the tight streets of Leningrad and the long rails of Novosibirsk have not been sufficiently practiced or defended.\n\nThe results have been cataclysmic. From bickering politicians who refused to act in the face of fascist bandit armies, to the near collapse against the counter-revolutionary republicans in the 50s- much has been lost. Millions of lives have been sacrificed unwillingly by those who would dare to neglect the lessons of the October revolution.\n\nThe Buryat "Sablinites" are next in the long line of this ideological rot. It is a rot that has clearly spread beyond control, as Valery Sablin himself was once a promising NKVD commissar. After being foolishly entrusted to organize labour in the construction of hydroelectric power near lake Baikal-he would seize a radio tower to spew his utopian, convenient revisionism.\n\nYagoda and the loyal remnants of the Presidium bear a gargantuan weight upon their shoulders. Years of defeat have left the union crippled, and its people susceptible to opportunists and liars. It is all too possible that this burgeoning rebel army could spiral out of control, and spell doom for the last remnant of order and legitimacy in this Russian chaos. The scared peasants who tremble beneath Sablin's lies must be convinced to return to their senses, and the conniving men who lead them must be brought to swift justice."
 IRK.5.a:0 "We will do what must be done..."

 IRK.6.t:0 "Sablin's End"
 IRK.6.desc:0 "Yagoda felt the cold flee from his body as his rage grew- It was a pure rage, so diffuse in its targets that its potency overwhelmed his mind.\n\nHe was angry at a great many things, and a great many people, and today made him especially furious. It was important that such rage was directed, and at this precise moment, it landed upon the guard to his right. A single stare leveled the man. His sloped posture rapidly corrected itself, and the incessant tapping of his foot ceased. That would do.\n\nHis composure regained, Yagoda's eyes returned to the malnourished creature that sat before him. The foolish boy who refused to break, or even bend. A lesser man might be swayed by such a display, but Yagoda was not impressed by traitors. He had seen too many.\n\nHis hands clasped together on the table, and he stared into Sablin's lowered eyes.\n"I tire of this spectacle. You have been offered a chance to repent your crimes, to show the people the error in your ways and heal the Union you fractured."\n\nYagoda noticed a fire flash across the young man's face, the same spark that he had observed upon detainment. He remained defiantly silent.\n"Maybe you perceive yourself as a brave man. I know better. Enough time has been wasted, there is much to be done beyond this petty revolt. If you wish for death, so be it."\n\nHis hand rose from the table, and upon his motioning Sablin was carried away. The new union would have no room for such foolish men. Utopians, Revisionists, and Squabbling politicians would no longer be allowed to destroy the dream fought for so long ago. If the Union was to reclaim life from the fascists, it would have to be stronger. This time, he would make sure it was."
 IRK.6.a:0 "Good riddance."

 IRK.7.t:0 "Reclaiming The Union"
 IRK.7.desc:0 "Genrikh Yagoda had been spending the evening as he usually did, meticulously going over the mountain of reports and dossiers that had accumulated in his office that day. On this occasion, however, the task was not as soul-grinding as usual, for each report painted small fragments of a much larger, optimistic picture: all of Yagoda's plans and hard work were finally coming together. One report stated clearly that any lingering Sablinite influence in Irkutsk had seemingly dissipated for good. It seems that all of the investigations and purges had borne fruit after all. Even now Yagoda couldn't help but feel remnants of anger and betrayal when he thought about the foolish exploits of the mutineers, and how their brazen defiance of the Union caused him so much trouble. At least now he could take comfort in the fact that they would never trouble him again.\n\nAfter some time, he had finally come to the real meat of that evening's reading: the Red Army's reports on combat readiness. What he saw was all the more promising. Not only did High Command report that the military was close to recovering all manpower lost during the mutiny, but also that the subsequent organizational reforms were going through without issue. Intermixed were various updates on the NKVD's espionage efforts into neighboring warlord states, and they had all come back with roughly the same conclusion: the Fascists' forces were hopelessly unable to match the Red Army in pitched battle. Once the proper plans of attack had been drawn up, Yagoda anticipated that the coming wars would be a mere triviality assuming the NKVD's reports were accurate.\n\nLighting a cigarette, Yagoda leaned back in his chair and began to think about the future. It was obvious that the war for the interior was coming to a close. From this point onward, his efforts would almost solely be focused on reclaiming whatever was wrestled away from the Soviet Union in its darkest hours. The uphill struggle to take back what was lost would soon begin, and the world would never be the same."
 IRK.7.a:0 "Failure is not an option."

 IRK.8.t:0 "The Great Purge"
 IRK.8.desc:0 ""Comrade Yagoda, you wished to speak with me?" Pavel Bulanov asked as he stepped into Yagoda's office. The door was pulled shut behind him, and the room was now silent, save for the clock on Yagoda's desk. "Have a seat, Comrade Bulanov." Genrikh Yagoda always had a humorless look about him, but there was something especially troubling about his demeanor this time. "Comrade Bulanov, I'm sure you are aware by now that I am rather displeased with the state of my administration?" Bulanov could only guess where this was headed."Yes, comrade, I have heard rumors."\n\n"Allow me to reveal to you how I really feel then. I'm absolutely livid, Bulanov. Ever since we defeated Sablin's merry band of traitors, it has become painfully clear that I am surrounded by corrupt buffoons who couldn't run an office to save their lives." Although Yagoda did not raise his voice, his eyes betrayed a great anger. "I see, have you tried scheduling a meeting? Perhaps you could speak sense into them, comrade." Yagoda frowned. "And continue to bash my head against a wall? Come now, Bulanov. I wouldn't have asked for my security chief if I intended to reason with these people." Yagoda then pushed a folder across his desk towards Bulanov. "This is a dossier of 'troublemakers' I have been gathering for some time. I want the NKVD to start a full investigation as soon as possible." Bulanov noticed a smaller piece of paper attached to the folder. Upon closer inspection, it was a list of names and instructions. "And what is this for, Comrade Yagoda?"\n\n"Those are people that I want behind bars or in front of a firing squad by tomorrow morning. I don't want my intentions to be misinterpreted by anyone, Comrade Bulanov. Our great Union is in for the wake-up call of a lifetime." Later that night, Pavel Bulanov arrived alone at the NKVD headquarters in Irkutsk. Only minutes later, a large column of trucks filled to the brim with NKVD officers left the compound under cover of darkness and rolled into the city to inflict terror upon the enemies of the people. The Great Purge had begun."
 IRK.8.a:0 "Screams and gunshots echoed through the night."

 IRK.9.t:0 "Into The Files"
 IRK.9.desc:0 "For the past two weeks, the special NKVD commission had been meeting in their headquarters in Irkutsk every day to lay the groundwork for investigating the more high-profile targets of Yagoda's purges. Files were examined, evidence was reviewed, and men's very fates were to be decided upon. Those who were in the commission were a veritable who's-who of the NKVD's highest echelons. Among them was Security Chief Pavel Bulanov, and, on this occasion, General Secretary Yagoda himself.\n\n"Now, comrades, that we are in the process of gathering enough evidence to arrest every man who has attained a Soviet political office in the past 10 years, there is still one question that we have yet to broach, and I figure now would be as good a time as any." Almost every man in the room looked to Bulanov in anticipation. "Once these men are in custody, how do you all propose they are dealt with?" Much to Bulanov's dismay, the room almost immediately fell into a deafening silence.\n\nAfter a deceptively long quiet intermixed with nervous glances and coughs, it was finally broken by a visibly irritated Yagoda. "You mean to tell me that you idiots have been meeting in this place for almost two goddamn weeks now and still haven't figured this out? What a joke." After further silence, only one officer had the courage to speak up. "Now that you mention it, that does seem like a rather important detail to leave open..." Yagoda only sighed and buried his face into his hand in response. Bulanov attempted to alleviate the situation before Yagoda began demanding names. "Comrade Yagoda, if I may, how do you think the punishments should be dealt? These investigations, after all, were your idea. Perhaps it would be best if you were the one to decide?" Yagoda lifted his head to respond. "We will show no mercy. These corrupt, incompetent parasites will be shot so that they may never trouble us again. As for those who are too useful to fill with lead, I will decide in due time. From now on, please do not make me do everything myself, comrades." With that, Yagoda left the room. The rest were not far behind."

 IRK.10.t:0 "The Irkutsk Trials"
 IRK.10.desc:0 ""Do the defendants admit to the crimes of treason, espionage, wrecking, terrorism, homicide, rape, arson, public indecency, and anti-Soviet activities?" As the prosecutor aggressively listed off increasingly absurd accusations, one could practically see what little hope had remained in the accused leaving their very bodies. What were once some of the highest-ranking bureaucrats in Irkutsk were now decrepit figures standing before what would become one of the most infamous trials in the town's entire history.The sad, condemned men gave a meek nod in response to the accusations. They had little strength left in them to resist the inevitable.\n\n"The court hereby finds the accused guilty of all charges, and sentences them to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad!" When these words were said, some men immediately collapsed to the floor and lost their nerve, while others remained standing in cold acceptance of their fate. In no time at all, a group of NKVD soldiers entered and began to violently pull the condemned men out of the ad-hoc courtroom and further into the depths of NKVD headquarters. As they were led through the claustrophobic basement halls, gunshots and panicked yelling could be heard all around them: poor souls who came before them being served their penalties from the barrel of a gun. Some of the prisoners in the group who were still in a state of despair were being dragged by their shirt collars against the ground, kicking and screaming as they went. If these men were going to hell, this place already made it look childish in comparison.\n\nEventually the group was led into a nondescript, concrete room with no windows and only a single dangling light. Some of the prisoners had pictured many places as being their final resting spot, but this glorified bathroom stall was probably the last one they would've expected. The NKVD soldiers ordered the prisoners against the wall, and forcefully shoved those who were too hysterical to move. Soon enough, everyone was lined up and ready."

 IRK.11.desc:0 ""You have to admit, Comrade Bulanov, although they were traitors, they sure as hell fought like devils." Field Marshal Maslennikov said as he took a sip of his vodka. "Indeed, and it still puzzles me as to how the hell they managed to find so many men and so many rifles under such short notice."\n\n"Hah! Just watch our own forces try and mobilize that fast. It would be a goddamn circus act!" Security Chief Bulanov knew that the Field Marshal was mostly joking, but he couldn't help in seeing the hints of some uncomfortable truths in his jest. When the mutiny began, the sheer size of Sablin's army was a cause for great concern amongst both the NKVD and the Red Army's High Command. Bulanov recalled that even General Secretary Yagoda himself was deeply troubled by the mutineers' ability to mobilize so quickly in comparison to his own forces. "If I had the chance, I'd set about whipping the men back into shape as soon as possible. When the time comes to march against the enemy once more, I don't want to be caught with my pants down again, you know?" Bulanov nodded in response as he took a drink. "You should know, Comrade Field Marshal, that Comrade Yagoda had asked for me to open inquiries into the Sablinite war effort. While I do not doubt his stalwart bravery in all things, I do believe he is still somewhat concerned our forces haven't learned anything from the mutiny. What do you think?"\n\nMaslennikov stopped to think for a moment. When he spoke again, he did so in hushed tones. "You want to know what I think, comrade? I think that if we were to combine our tactics with that of the mutineers, there would not be a single force from the Urals to Kamchatka that could hold our armies back." Perhaps it was because he was just a little drunk, but Bulanov began entertaining the thought that Maslennikov's theory might be necessary. Even after he had stumbled home that evening, Pavel Bulanov still couldn't stop thinking about his discussions with the Field Marshal."

 IRK.12.desc:0 ""What's wrong with them, Maslennikov?" Genrikh Yagoda asked as he walked, not bothering to look back at the entourage that flanked him. The weekly troop inspection had gone without any notable incident as usual, but this time Yagoda seemed much less impressed than usual. "What do you mean, Comrade Yagoda? Was there some kind of problem?" Maslennikov tried to maintain an air of martial professionalism as he spoke, but his tone betrayed a slight hint of fear. Yagoda stopped and finally looked Maslennikov in the eyes. "What do I mean? Did you see them? That boy who sneezed looked like he was about to shit himself."\n\n"Perhaps they fear they'll disappoint you, Comrade Yagoda. Rest assured, the soldiers owe you their utmost devotion and loyalty." Yagoda was still not impressed, and it showed. "The only reason they're loyal is because they're terrified of me, not devoted." After a pause, the walk continued. "Do you remember Sablin's traitors, Maslennikov? Those bastards were willing to follow that damn boy into hell when it came to it. I shudder to think how those frightened souls back there would do in similar circumstances." The group finally arrived at Yagoda's staff car, and the time came for that afternoon's farewells. "Make sure the men are in good order next time, Comrade Field Marshal. I will be in touch." After an exchange of salutes, Yagoda departed from the base.\n\nThe quiet ride gave Yagoda plenty of time to think. He knew that this problem was far more encompassing than just the army. The entire nation saw him as some kind of monster, despite all their efforts to hide these feelings from the public eye. Meanwhile, that bastard Sablin had transformed his image into that of a hero virtually overnight. Yagoda wondered if perhaps he should make some kind of attempt at softening his image. However, Yagoda also knew that he could not risk looking weak in these desperate times. By the time Yagoda had arrived at his office, he had made up his mind."

Are our policies really so terrible? It's not like they've changed much since Bukharin's day, and nobody was raising a fuss back then." Sergey Bessonov, Yagoda's foreign minister, thought of what to say next. Every so often the two would meet in unassuming locales to discuss things that they would never dare to speak of at the workplace, lest they draw the attention of the feared NKVD. This particular morning, they had found themselves in a sleepy cafe in Irkutsk's suburbs, and the subject was dangerously close to becoming more controversial than usual. Bessonov seemed to care little. "Grigori... do you think that maybe his promises held merit?" Grinko immediately halted raising his mug as he heard this, and looked up at Bessonov. "What are you saying, exactly?" He said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"His men were willing to lay down their lives for his ideas, fought us tooth and nail. We may not like it, but there had to be something worth looking at there. It just wouldn't make sense otherwise." Grinko resumed his drinking, his posture slackening once more. "Eh, maybe. How do we know it wasn't just all talk, though? All you have to do is say the right words, and people will die for you. Sablin obviously knew that well, but we'll never know if it was coming from a genuine place."\n\n"Perhaps not. But who's to say we can't succeed where he failed? It would surely go a long way towards endearing us to the people." Grinko looked up at Bessonov again. "Most of what Sablin talked about was idealistic drivel, nothing more. The truth is, you can't run an effective government on dreams alone. Though sometimes I think it wouldn't hurt if we reexamined how we approached certain issues..." Bessonov leaned forward. "It wouldn't, right? If only Comrade Yagoda would see it that way.""

I just got off the phone with Bessonov, he says the partisans in Aldan have sent us a response defying our ultimatum and denouncing you as a tyrant! What should we do?"\n\nYagoda's eyes returned to his reading, his face did not betray even the smallest hint of concern. "How very stupid of them. Ochirov must have a death wish. Comrade Bulanov, tell the Field Marshal to prepare his troops for war. I want him to teach those impudent whelps in Aldan a lesson they won't soon forget."

The base of the map itself was from the 1940's, and it had been hastily drawn over in marker to show what the Red Army believed to be the strategic situation. "As you can see, comrades, the Fascists are divided and weak. We couldn't have asked for a better opportunity to strike." Field Marshal Lyushkov said as he gestured towards the enemy positions on the map, represented with lines of red marker. Lyushkov was not wrong. Intel on the situation farther east was not exactly ideal, but it all seemed to suggest that the Fascist warlords were too busy squabbling amongst themselves to offer any serious resistance to an invasion. Yagoda, his attention still focused on the map, spoke up. "Lyushkov, how ready are our forces?" Lyushkov backed away from the map and turned to Yagoda. "As ready as they'll ever be, Comrade Yagoda."\n\n"Then I think, comrades, it is time to put our plans into motion. These fascist dogs have blighted Russia with their toxic presence for too long. It would bring me great pleasure to see them crushed like the vermin they are." Yagoda paused for a moment. "Remember that this is a very important step towards reunification, comrades. First we retake the Far East, then we liberate the rest of Russia and beyond. I will not accept failure, not when the fate of the Soviet Union still lies on the precipice." Yagoda's short speech would resonate heavily with all who heard. The next few months would see the lands of the Far East drenched in blood, and with a great deal of effort and a little luck, only the true heirs to the Soviet Union would remain standing once the smoke had cleared.

I have seen what cruelties these Fascists are capable of in victory, and I made a promise to myself to never allow such injustices to happen ever again." The commissar got up and stood in front of his men. He could feel the orator inside him taking over.\n\n"This is not just a war against those who have betrayed the people, but a war against to repulse the dark clouds of Fascism that loom over everything we hold dear. It is not wrong to feel fear, but it is wrong to allow your fear to shape you. Think of your friends, your homes, your loved ones! Would you stand by as these Fascist dogs march in to impose their murderous rule over them? Comrades, put your fear behind you and fill your hearts with rage! Build this anger within you and use it well when the time comes to send these murdering Fascist bastards to an early grave!"\n\nKrukov's short speech was punctuated by fierce, passionate cheers from the men.

Those who were present noted that he seemed strangely calm and collected throughout the whole ordeal. In a few minutes, a single NKVD guard pulled Matkovsky by his collar and led him out of the courtroom.\n\nOnce they had reached the basement door, the guard knocked on the door to be let in. He sighed and stood in front of the door idly, wondering why they didn't just leave it open. The guard's thoughts were interrupted by a sharp blow to the side of his head. As the guard fell to the floor, Matkovsky scrambled to grab his keys. The guard was unable to react before Matkovsky had freed himself and made a run for it.\n\nWasting no time, he sprinted after Matkovsky, and soon the guard was joined by several of his comrades. The NKVD followed Matkovsky as he slipped into the men's bathroom, and they easily broke through the haphazard barricade he had made with his shackles. When they entered, the NKVD soldiers were immediately met with Matkovsky attempting and failing to open a locked window at the end of the bathroom stalls. Realizing he was trapped, Matkovsky gave up and turned to his pursuers.\n\nHe gave a defeated sigh, and called out to them. "Well, get on with it."

The group abruptly stopped in the basement hall, and the commanding officer turned to his comrades.\n\n"Someone get me a rag or a handkerchief or something, we need to shut this idiot up." One of the NKVD then wandered off to find a suitable object, and soon returned with a cloth. As the soldier attempted to gag Rodzaevsky, however, the prisoner headbutted the soldier and began violently shaking and kicking. In this state, moving the prisoner was impossible. Rodzaevsky was in such a rage that he had nearly managed to overpower his captors, despite their numbers.\n\n"You are weak! I could take all of you bolshevik sons of bi-" Before the verbal assault could continue, a bullet ripped through the side of Rodzaevsky's head and killed him instantly.

Knowing that they would have been effortlessly targeted and "persuaded" by the NKVD, whoever was behind this plan was careful not to reveal their identity, at least before the document had been presented to all Presidium members.

The hesitant few who did not out of fear soon changed their minds, making the result of the vote, besides two persons, unanimous. One was Yagoda, still not eager to idly follow the wishes of the Party; as for the other, it was Agranov himself. The Presidium had taken advantage of him being away in Magadan to initiate this vote without his knowledge. Yagoda was aware that the presence of every single deputy was not necessary to pass a decree - a loophole that had proven extremely useful in the past, but had come back to bite him. Having been left with no other choice, he slowly raised his hand in approval.\n\n"Effective immediately, Comrade Agranov is dismissed of his duties by order of the Presidium, to be replaced by Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov as Premier of the USSR."

Today he heard a Magadan drinking party silence one of their revelers before he could tell a political joke, Sergey Bessonov sharing an intimate moment with his wife, and a young couple in Kamchatka making plans to cross the Bering Strait and defect to America. He made a note to have NKVD operatives dispatched to deal with that last one, and then smiled.\n\nGeneral-Secretary Yagoda was finally in his element. This was the Soviet Union, his Soviet Union, the way it was meant to be run. Not by party apparatchiks and palace schemers, but by loyal, disciplined intelligence agents.

The NKVD were secret police, not soldiers, but their loyalty to Yagoda was beyond dispute. If they were the only forces in the next parade, the whole Union would know who really calls the shots.\n\nBut maybe he was being paranoid, he mused. The Red Army hadn't betrayed him when Sablin rose up. If they were going to take a stand against his centralized state, they would have done it long ago. While he could trust the NKVD's loyalty, he couldn't trust their performance in battle.

The reactionaries are many, savage and relentless in their desire to see the worker's state extinguished. But the tide has turned, the dark days of the 40s and 50s are behind us. Our enemies will not succeed. History is on our side, as it always has been.\n\nNow as we take our first steps back onto the international stage, I will say to our diplomats, that I have full confidence in your skill, your devotion and your loyalty. You shall be the vanguard of the revolution abroad.From today onwards the oppressed nations of the world are no longer alone."\n\n- Genrikh Yagoda, [GetDateText]"

 IRK.31.t:0 "Message from across the Pacific"
 IRK.31.desc:0 "We have received a radio message from Irkutsk in Siberia from a warlord state that claims to be the legitimate successor of the USSR. Centred on the city of Irkutsk, this state is led by Genrikh Yagoda, the former head of the NKVD, while numerous high-ranking government members appear to be members of Bukharin's cabinet who have been evacuated to the city.\n\nAlthough Irkutsk by and large appears to be far more authoritarian than the old USSR, with the secret police seemingly exerting significant control over the region, they claim this to be a necessity due to internal instability and the threat of outside agents, and that they will liberalize once the government is able to stabilize the situation. They request diplomatic recognition by our government and the possibility of cooperation between our governments in the future."
 IRK.31.a:0 "We are open to the possibility of further relations in the future."
 IRK.31.b:0 "Just another warlord with delusions of grandeur."
 
 IRK.32.t:0 "Request for Recognition"
 IRK.32.desc:0 "After the opening of formal communication channels between the US and Irkutsk, Yagoda requests that we formally recognize Irkutsk, as a sovereign state and that they send emissaries to Washington DC to further discuss diplomatic relations between us and them.\n\nIrkutsk appears to be the most legitimate successor state of the former Soviet Union, with the government continuing many former policies and being run by many high-ranking former Soviet government members. Although they do not ask for formal recognition as the USSR's successor state, the continuity they possess with the old Soviet government makes it an ideal candidate for support from us and makes them a likely candidate for Soviet reunification, and for a potentially powerful ally which can properly face the fascist menace in Europe."
 IRK.32.a:0 "An old ally returns."
 IRK.32.b:0 "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result."

 IRK.33.t:0 "An Embassy in America"
 IRK.33.desc:0 "Excellent news has been received by radio this morning: the United States government has officially recognised us as a sovereign state and will be sending aircraft to Irkutsk to transport our representatives to Washington D.C. They say no construction space is available for the creation of a new building to serve as an embassy, but there are plenty of existing buildings which can be easily renovated to serve as one in the near future."

 IRK.34.t:0 "America Rejects us"
 IRK.34.desc:0 "Terrible news has been received by radio from the United States: the government has refused to recognize us as a sovereign nation, much less agreed to receive ambassadors from us. In the message that they sent to us this morning, they claimed that we are nothing more than a "warband with delusions of grandeur" that they "cannot waste time or resources" in supporting. It appears that we will need to look elsewhere to train our troops."

 IRK.35.t:0 "Funding Request from Siberia"
 IRK.35.desc:0 "The government of Irkutsk sent a request to the OFN headquarters this morning regarding the sending of funds to support their army. They say they need the money to expand their forces and secure the surrounding area under a OFN-friendly banner. Although the country is small, a successful Irkutsk unification of Eastern Siberia and the regions beyond would place large regions of Eurasia in the hands of a regime friendly to the OFN - if they were to even unify Russia, it would give us a valuable ally against fascism as well."

No more will we be a petty warlord state in a backwater: trained by the bravest men the free world has to offer, and equipped with the most advanced technology in the world, Siberia, and indeed all of Russia will be an oyster that is ours for the taking!"
 IRK.36.a:0 "Excellent!"

 IRK.37.t:0 "Dollars Denied"
 IRK.37.desc:0 "Radio communication teams report terrible news: the OFN has refused to fund the modernization of our army. In the message sent to us this morning, OFN representatives stated that they "have no interest in supporting warlordism in Russia," and that they "will wait until a legitimate successor state to the USSR can be found" before sending aid to Russia. This message not only demonstrates a complete unwillingness to help small nations in need, but is in total contradiction to our numerous continuities with the old Soviet government."

 IRK.38.t:0 "A Message from the Far East"
 IRK.38.desc:0 "This morning a radio broadcast traced to Irkutsk was received from a local Soviet successor state known as the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic. This state, led by former head of the NKVD Genrikh Yagoda apparently has numerous continuities in policies and personnel with the old Soviet government, which lends itself an air of legitimacy in the chaotic wake of its collapse. The Irkutsk government wishes to open up relationships with us in the hopes that they can serve as a friendly power in Siberia."
 IRK.38.a:0 "Interesting..."

 IRK.39.t:0 "An Embassy for Yagoda?"
 IRK.39.desc:0 "We have received another radio broadcast from the Far East SSR, this time requesting recognition as a sovereign nation and the opening of an embassy in Tokyo. They say formal relations between us and them will be of great benefit to Japan, as despite the fact that they are a radical communist regime, they too oppose Germany and are willing to secure the region in the name of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. With further aid and support, they could potentially unify Siberia and even Russia under a single state friendly to our interests."
 IRK.39.a:0 "We must think pragmatically in such hard times. (Accept)"
 IRK.39.b:0 "We have no interest in supporting a petty Communist warlord. (Reject)"

 IRK.40.t:0 "The Japanese Empire Accepts!"
 IRK.40.desc:0 "We have received excellent news by radio from Tokyo: the Japanese government received our requests for diplomatic recognition, but they will also accept the emissaries we send to them to discuss the possibilities of cooperation against Germany and to build a secure bloc in Siberia. A suitable building has been found in the suburbs of Tokyo that can serve as an embassy, and the Japanese government will be sending aircraft to transport our diplomats there shortly."
 IRK.40.a:0 "A red sun rises over Asia."

 IRK.41.t:0 "The Japanese Empire refuses!"
 IRK.41.desc:0 "Terrible news was received by radio from Tokyo: the Japanese government refused to recognize us as a sovereign nation, nor will they accept any envoys from us. In their broadcast, they claimed we were "Communist tyrants" and "petty warlords that Japan has no interest in". No doubt the indoctrinated cultists of their Emperor were afraid of the spread of our socialist ideology and the possibility of a revolution among the working class across Asia if they were to support us."
 IRK.41.a:0 "It's a shame how reactionary ideology can blind people."
 
 IRK.42.t:0 "The Revolution Lives!"
 IRK.42.desc:0 "We have received a radio broadcast from Irkutsk in Siberia from a socialist regime known as the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic. This state is led by the former head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda. While they boast the same policies and even government ministers as the old Soviet government, it also unsurprisingly appears that the NKVD plays a large role in Far Eastern society, with the police state and surveillance being extensive. Yagoda claims this is a temporary measure to preserve socialism in the state, and that he will lessen the NKVD grip on society once the situation stabilises; however, the question of whether to support an extensive police state with ties to the old Soviet government remains."

 IRK.43.t:0 "Back in the ASSR"
 IRK.43.desc:0 "Imperialism is merely capitalism in decay, wrote Lenin, and the imperialistic conflict between nations is nearly as important as the class struggle. To this end, Lenin created the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics so that even small nationals can express the right of self-determination within the Russian Federative Soviet Republic.\n\nNevertheless, as our borders expand and more ethnic minorities are incorporated within them, the question of whether or not the existing laws on the autonomy of the ASSRs are sufficient has been increasingly raised. The conservative faction claims that the autonomy they exhibit currently (that is, the ability to draft a constitution within the bounds of the national constitution) are enough; critics believe that more autonomy, particularly when it comes to economics, must be given to them to minimize the economic exploitation of these ethnic minorities by the central government."
 IRK.43.a:0 "We must preserve and expand the rights of minorities wherever possible! (Accept)"
 IRK.43.b:0 "There is no exploitation in the USSR! (Reject)"

 IRK.44.t:0 "Socialist Realism"
 IRK.44.desc:0 "This morning, Yagoda announced by radio the expansion of "cultural protection" measures, intended to "protect the working class from reactionary influence". Claiming that "it is not yet the time to allow the propagation of reactionary ideals in society", Yagoda said, "the NKVD will continue its duties of minimizing the worker's exposure to them in the media."\n\nThe creation of a new "Bureau of Socialist Media" was announced in the speech, where new films, books and other forms of media publications will be screened by NKVD agents before public release to ensure "reactionary" and "bourgeois" content is kept to a minimum, which the government believes could potentially indoctrinate the working class with counterrevolutionary ideas. Yagoda also added that artworks like posters, painting and sculptures will need to be registered with the Bureau as well.\n\n"Although these measures may seem harsh, these are necessary to preserve socialist freedoms in a world surrounded by capitalists, reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries who seek to undermine and destroy the workers' paradise from within," he concluded."
 IRK.44.a:0 "Great are the burdens to be endured for socialism."

 IRK.45.t:0 "The Cultural Revolution"
 IRK.45.desc:0 "In a speech delivered in the Tikhvin Gostinodvorskaya Square, Yagoda has announced the beginnings of a new sponsorship program supporting the arts.\n\n"Socialism is the liberation of man from the economic chains that bind him," Yagoda said to the crowd assembled in the city square, "And it is only under socialism that man will finally be free to express himself without being bound by market demand!"\n\nThe new cultural program unveiled by Yagoda this afternoon is extensive. Starting from the next fiscal year, the state will be granting endowments to painters, authors, filmmakers and other artists, with particular focus on socialist realist art that can be easily accessed and understood by the working class in the form of sculptures, murals and films glorifying the struggle of the proletariat from 1917 onwards. A new Museum of Socialist Art is also in the planning stages, which will showcase the best pieces of Soviet artwork to the world."

 IRK.46.desc:0 ""Good evening, comrades.", said the voice over the crackly radio. "We will be departing from our previous programming in this time slot from now on. Comrade Yagoda has wisely concluded that these prime hours should be filled with inspirational messages about our beloved motherland. To that end, we have one of the finest Soviet actors in the studio with us tonight to read a war-era poem which is most dear to our Russian hearts. Vasily Alexeyvich, if you would."\n\nThe young actor began reading out loud. His voice came in beautifully over the airwaves. Listeners in taverns paused their conversations to incline their ears.\n\n"Because we are Russian, just fire and destruction\nAre all we abandon behind as we go.\nAnd fighting beside us, our comrades are dying\nAnd we Russians only die facing their foe.\n\nAlyosha, till now we've been spared by the bullets.\nBut when (for the third time) my life seemed to end,\nI yet still felt proud of the dearest of countries,\nThe great bitter land I was born to defend."\n\nEven the most jaded of listeners felt a fire stirring in their hearts at these old words brought to life. Some of the younger ones even began to consider enlisting in the Red Army themselves. If the people were not in love with their Motherland before, they were passionately so now."
 IRK.46.a:0 "Remember, Alyosha, the roads of Smolenshchina"

The patriarch had denounced his own son for listening to bootleg Western records. The son, in turn, had denounced his mother for prostitution, a parasitic form of non-labour income. The Major shook his head.\n\n"Your orders, Comrade Major? Over.", said the squad leader over the radio. His NKVD agents were in place to breach the door on the family's apartment. They just needed final confirmation on who they would apprehend.\n\n"Take the three of them. Put them in separate cells when you get here. I'll have my boys at the office type up something for each of them to sign. You know which methods to use if they refuse. And one more thing...\n\n"Yes, Comrade Major?

 IRK.48.t:0 "The Good Life"
 IRK.48.desc:0 "It had been a good year for Ivan Grachyov. By working for Goskomtsen, the State Committee on Prices, he knew the legal price of every single item in the Soviet Union. And ever since General-Secretary Yagoda had raised his and every other civil servant's salary, he'd been able to afford much more of those items. His dinner table never lacked meat, and his new car was never out of gas.\n\nThe car was his proudest purchase. Even with his new salary, he'd had to save up to afford it. And then there was the waiting list and all the hoops he'd had to jump through to even get an American car imported into Siberia. But by New Years, he was the proud owner of a new Ford.\n\nThat New Years Eve, he decided to show it off to all his coworkers at Goskomtsen. He revved the engine and did donuts in the front yard. Then he invited his favorite colleague to go on a ride down the streets of Irkutsk. It was frowned upon by the police, but he'd earned this. Yagoda himself had approved his salary, it's time he lived well and fast for once.\n\nPity he'd also spent a bit of that new salary on fine, imported cognac that night."

Toot his own horn a bit, slip the HR man a fifth of fine brandy, share some cigarettes and call it a day. But when he walked into the office and saw a man in a blue-topped peaked cap sitting at the desk, all the color drained from his face.\n\n"Comrade Ganayev, our investigations have found significant discrepancies between throughput figures at the Dukat and Kubaka silver mines and the amount of minted silver bullion that your ministry deposits into our reserves each month. The discrepancies first emerged when you received your executive post. How do you account for this?"\n\nIgor tried to think on his feet. He blamed the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metallurgy. He blamed the Mafia. He blamed German spies. He deflected to anyone he could. None of it seemed to faze the NKVD agent at the desk. All he did was sigh, shake his head, and take notes in his little book. Eventually, he put up his hand to silence Igor and spoke up.\n\n"Comrade Ganayev, your guilt was determined prior to our meeting. My inquiry here was simply to see whether or not you could provide us the names of your co-conspirators. Unfortunately, you have seen fit to waste the People's Commissariat's time with your evasive drivel. So let me be frank with you, Comrade."\n\nThe agent leaned in closer.\n\n"If you have stolen the People's silver, we will fill you with the People's lead.""

Perched upon an outcropping that emerged from the depths of Lake Baikal, he glanced back towards his neatly folded clothes on the shore. A younger Ilya would have been afraid to exhibit such lax behavior on duty, but the last few days had changed him immensely. A peace had come over the aging murderer, a peace he refused to vacate.\n\nHis eyes turned to the green waters before him, taking their time to meet the sunkissed horizon. Below it, he saw the faint outlines of Nerpa seals, unique little fishermen who frequently found themselves pestered by birds.\n\nIn many ways he related to the birds. He was, like them, a pest. While the people of Irkutsk city attempted to carve out lives in this Russian hell, Ilya harassed them. In his head sat thousands of words, snippets of conversations between lovers, friends, families. All of them were stolen, private snapshots of lives acquired via surveillance.\n\nUpon his hands there was much blood. Young and old, idealist and cynic, patriot and traitor. Each had met with Ilya's justice at one time or another.\n\nHe laughed quietly at the dramatic tone of his thoughts. What had made the Sablinites any different? The regret he felt now, the one that had seemingly turned him into an aspiring poet, was one he hadn't experienced in decades.\n\nPerhaps though, Ilya was the seal instead. A man haunted by his own pests, invisible to him for many years. The seal to a thousand lurking birds that had finally come home to roost.\n\nAs he stood up from the rock and began his long swim to shore, he made a decision. Ilya would not be returning to Irkutsk. All that had tied him to that place seemed shattered by whatever realizations the lake had bestowed. His duty was as faint as a distant cloud.\n\nSo it was that an NKVD veteran abandoned his duties, and set off for the Siberian wastes."

The territory that's being reintegrated is gigantic, nephew, bigger than any nation could be asked to swallow up at once. Obviously it's going badly compared to past reintegrations, but that doesn't mean it's going horribly. We've been adopting existing administrative entities within the territory as fast as we possibly can, but most are messy entities leftover from the warlords.

It is your official title, given to you by the USSR, after all. Listen, Marshal, Comrade Yagoda has some sympathy for you. Your army was given orders by the government: defend the east. And so you did, even when it was no longer clear if a government still existed at all. It's obviously not the case that you were disloyal, Marshal, merely that you were confused as to whom were the rightful heirs to the old government. Well, now you know. It's us."\n\n"What are you getting at," sighed Vasilevsky.\n\n"What I'm getting at is your reputation, Marshal.

The perpetrator had done little to nothing to cover his tracks, likely expecting to get away with it due to his rank.\n\nHad he not been clear that the years of corruption were over? That fraud would no longer be tolerable in his government? That transgressions against the legitimacy of the state would be met with death?\n\nPerhaps he had been too merciful in the past, too lenient to truly send the correct message. Yes, if there was one thing that Comrade Yagoda knew was true of himself, it was that he was a merciful man. Anyone else in his position who was looking out over the seditious world he ruled over would have burned it all down.\n\nHis old bony fingers spun the phone dial and he lifted the receiver to his ear.\n\n"Yes, chairman?" asked his secretary.\n\n"There's a man we need to make an example of," Comrade Yagoda said, without joy, but only with duty."

For ten minutes of screentime, villagers are shown to be in a miserable state as Hitler and his Nazis rampage through town. Just when all seems lost, the phoenix rises again, now resembling Comrade Yagoda, and throws the Nazis out, to the cheers and adoration of the town.\n\nThe animation is only 38 minutes long, and foreign observers have derided it as being decades out of date artistically speaking. They may be right, as it most resembles the relatively crude propaganda films that had come out of Japan in the mid 40's, save that the Russian animators had taken special care to ensure that the colour red was in the film, even if the rest of it was black and white.\n\nRegardless of what the foreigners think, it's a hit, and the masses are clearly warming up to Yagoda's cult of personality."

He flipped his notebook shut and handed it to one of the other plainclothes NKVD agents who was present.\n\n"Round up all those who spoke out, make sure no one knows it's you," Kyrill ordered. His lips curled into a wicked grin."

 IRK_superregional.7.t:0 "A Memory of the Mutineer"
 IRK_superregional.7.desc:0 "Genrikh Yagoda watched the lights flicker in his office. Re-industrialization was going well, but the old systems that had yet to be replaced and rewired were still nothing to rely on.\n\nOutdated or not, the fact that so much of his territory had power at all was a testament to his success.\n\nHe reached over his reports to drink from a glass of cool water, enjoying the feeling as it chilled his throat and mouth.\n\nSo much success, and they had come so close, within mere inches of losing it all in the uprising of the 'leninist' turncoat, Valery Sablin.\n\nIt was a defining moment for the USSR, the greatest challenge she had ever faced.\n\nHe remembered the day he received the report. For an instant, a single instant of coldblooded panic and hopeless terror, Genrikh thought he could understand what old Bukharin felt the day they told him that the Wehrmacht had invaded.\n\nGenrikh wasn't there that day, but he had informants who were. They said Bukharin had shrivelled when he heard - wilting like a flower before an inferno.\n\nAnd so, when Yagoda faced the same circumstance, the same test of will - staring national downfall in the face - he knew that he could not flounder as Bukharin had done. Yagoda remained strong, remained composed, and patiently moved to handle the upstart.\n\nGenrikh smiled. It was the first of many tests of his resurgent nation, but there were many more to come. He took pen in hand and returned to his paperwork once more, renewed in his will to succeed."
 IRK_superregional.7.a:0 "The new USSR, like it's leadership, will be stronger than the old."

 IRK_superregional.8.t:0 "The End of the Gulags!"
 IRK_superregional.8.desc:0 "In a rare and welcome upset to Soviet politics, Sergei Bessonov has continued to pleasantly surprise his nation in sticking to his promised reforms to create a less oppressive USSR. Though the NKVD has been grumbling quietly about it, it's unlikely that such an organization would protest publicly at the changes, nor does it seem likely that they'll make a move against the party now that stability has finally started to return to the nation.\n\nBessonov drafted legislation this morning to do something unthinkable to many, ending the gulag labour camps and put an end to a nearly forty year old institution of national repression.\n\nTo alleviate concerns that dangerous dissidents are being released out into the nation, Bessonov has arranged for a fair retrial of the forced labourers based upon the modern enforcement of the law rather than the harsh policies of Yagoda.\n\nOther critics have pointed out that the end of the gulags will cripple the state's ability to build infrastructure or other large projects, but the party insists that anything built on the backs of slave labour is not worth being built.\n\nOn the other hand, former prisoners are being formally offered jobs and good wages to continue working in 'construction camps,' though it's unknown how many will take up this offer in favour of leaving the entire nightmare behind."

 IRK_superregional.9.t:0 "The New Role of the Nomenklatura"
 IRK_superregional.9.desc:0 ""Perhaps you misunderstand me, comrade. I am a member of the Nomenklatura!" insisted Artur to the stuffy bureaucrat.\n\nThe bureaucrat smiled and nodded placatively as though speaking to a child.\n\n"Yes you are, comrade Artur, and here is your important Nomenklatura desk and your important Nomenklatura paperwork," said the impudent administrator, causing Artur's lip to curl in anger.\n\nThe 'desk' in question was far less than he deserved, little more than sheet metal welded into a surface with a few drawers. It was a mass-produced thing that was unworthy of him. And as if the entire matter wasn't insulting enough, the 'paperwork' in question, upon a brief look, seemed to be utterly unimportant reports confirming grain shipments to and from irrelevant and impoverished villages on the far fringes of civilization!\n\n"Comrade! I am a member of the Nomenklatura!" he bellowed in anger.\n\n"Yes you are," agreed the bureaucrat with a polite nod. "Now have those reports on my desk by six PM.""
 IRK_superregional.9.a:0 "A very special job for a very special boy."

 IRK_superregional.10.t:0 "Investigating the Personality Cult"
 IRK_superregional.10.desc:0 "The Bessonov administration has spent perhaps more time than might have been thought strictly necessary investigating the cult of personality that Genrikh Yagoda had built for himself. Among other things, a series of rejected propaganda photos which involved a shirtless Yagoda hunting, fishing, and riding on horseback through the wilderness have been passed around with great amusement between the party members.\n\nThe effects of the cult surrounding Yagoda, however, are no laughing matter, as they allowed him to act as an unimpeded dictator that could step over the proletariat as though they were his personal slaves without any fear of retaliation or checks on his power.\n\nAfter the party was finished cackling at a picture of Yagoda holding a leopard (once again, while shirtless,) they elected to prevent such a thing from happening again.\n\nClarifications were made to the public as to what the old administration had been lying about, as well warning the public to never throw away their ability to think skeptically, even when it's the government speaking.\n\nAdditionally, limits were introduced, among other precautions, about how much could be written or broadcast about the chairmen or other important politicians compared to other news topics, to prevent any temptation on the part of future chairmen to force the state media to fixate upon him."
 IRK_superregional.10.a:0 "Hey look, a picture of Yagoda climbing a mountain! Where's his shirt?"

 IRK_superregional.11.t:0 "An Anonymous Virtuoso?"
 IRK_superregional.11.desc:0 "The crowds flooding into Verkhneudinsk Opera House last night were record breaking as local singer Dominika Kuznetsova performed the first wholly original work of operatic music in nearly twenty years.\n\nThe performance drew in both the frequent opera goers as well as the old enthusiasts who'd grown bored of the same shows and songs being performed week after week. The performance itself was a hit, and while the piece is not considered to be one of the all-time greats of Russian music, it was certainly a welcome new addition.\n\nKuznetzova herself has declined to reveal the identity of the songwriter, insisting that 'he would like to remain anonymous.' Whoever he is, it's clear that Buryat would like to hear more of his work.\n\nAs if to spoil the fun, a recent arrival in the city, who claims to have resided in Tomsk up until recently, insists that the piece is a rip off of an identical piece of music that had been composed and presented in Tomsk, but merely with a few 'awkward sounding' changes to make the piece sound less subversive to the communist government.\n\nBeing that the work stumbles at a few strange places, despite flowing beautifully elsewhere - it could be that he's right."

 IRK_superregional.12.t:0 "A Deal with the Devil"
 IRK_superregional.12.desc:0 "A minute passes, a small sip of wine.\n\nA minute passes, a small sip of wine.\n\nThat had been the actions of one tired man residing in Tomsk. Of course, his actions were not uncommon, for it had been repeated across the city. Many mourned for the Central Siberian Republic, and for the dream of Democracy.\n\nThat, however, were not the only reasons the man drank, for he was a Humanist politician in the Central Siberian Republic, and he lost more than the dream of Democracy. No, for his political career as a Humanist went up in flames along with Tomsk's ideals, and unless he accepted the offer gave by the Government in Irkutsk, he may be forced to live in a cold prison cell. Or worse.\n\nBut that would involve betraying his ideals, for Irkutsk was the complete opposite of all his ideals. They did not support the ideas of Democracy, their leaders were the same men that oppressed his former Humanist colleagues, and their leader is a raving despot. For him to even think about accepting their "generous" offer, he would have to swallow his pride whole.\n\nBut are his pride and ideals really worth more than his life?\n\nSwallowing the remainder of the wine he had in his hand, the man swore and dialed the phone."
 IRK_superregional.12.a:0 ""I accept", the man muttered."

 IRK_superregional.13.t:0 "A Memory of Tyranny"
 IRK_superregional.13.desc:0 "It was while touring a building site and happily noting the new worker safety precautions that had been taken, that Sergei Bessonov came to the long overdue certainty that he had made the right decision.\n\nGenrikh Yagoda would never have done this, would never have cared what went on in a coal mine beyond sheer productivity. But Sergei did, and while the other might have complained that it was a waste of resources while the USSR had more important matters to attend to, the truth had been that Bessonov's reforms had built a strong, united, and motivated nation, quite unlike the reluctant police state he had inherited from his predecessor.\n\nGenrikh Yagoda.\n\nBessonov felt his fists curl up in anger at the memories. Socialism was meant to serve the people, not oppress them, and yet to the tyrant-in-chief, the people were nothing more than slaves to his state machinery. So much was at stake with the flourishing state they had preserved here in the far east, and thanks to Yagoda, most of it had been lost or compromised to rebellions.\n\nBessonov promised he would prove himself better, and today he was finally certain that he had done so. But Bessonov had made another promise too, one that would be a lifelong endeavor.\n\nNo one like Yagoda would ever rise to power again."
