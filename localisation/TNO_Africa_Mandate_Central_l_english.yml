 COG_USA_central_african_developments_desc:0 "Central Africa must maintain a steady balance on producing capital for investors back home and maintaining stability within its borders\n\nThe aim of the temporary §BOFN Mandates§! in Africa is to serve as transition between German rule and local sovereignty.\n\nIf we manage to peacefully carry out our decolonization plans, we will be able to bring back §O80%§! of the resources we have generated here.\n\nIf we choose to prematurely decolonize, we will only be able to bring back §O40%§! of the resources we have generated here.\n\nIn the case of a complete collapse of the mandate, we will we will have to §Rabandon§! the resources we have generated here."

POLITICS_CREIGHTON_ABRAMS_DESC:0 "Years ago, in the fields of England, Creighton Abrams won acclaim and renown for his actions in the disastrous intervention in England. Now, in ultimate victory over the Nazi regime in Africa, he has found only scorn and resentment. As the wildfire of conventional war has descended into a slowly burning insurgency, General Abrams has been put in the uncomfortable position of crushing the insurgency determining the political future of the Congo.\n\nLegacy German officials in the Congo administration have observed that under Abrams, there has been more continuity than change from Muller's regime. Despite paying lip service to winning hearts and minds Abrams has continued to apply a light touch to both the companies operating in the Congo and the natives struggling to survive in the war-torn nation. Already under fire from Washington due to allegations of massacres carried out by his troops during the offensives across Namibia, Abrams is also under immense economic pressure to continue giving companies a free hand in the region.\n\nThings for Abrams have changed immensely since the English disaster. There is no glory in this war, and any victory would be cheap consolation for the thousands of lives lost. As the papers at home shout for their boys to come back, General Abrams must decide how to best leave America's mark on the region before his inevitable return home."
