 POLITICS_REINHARD_HEYDRICH_DESC:0 "Heydrich has many names. The Blonde Beast. The Butcher of Prague. The Young Evil God of Death. After narrowly surviving an assassination attempt during the World War, Heydrich personally assisted his men in hunting down and wiping out thousands in the former Czechoslovakia. Pictures of him standing triumphantly over the ruins and destruction he had sown were used as German propaganda throughout the war, and Goebbels even (though reportedly rather begrudgingly) had filmed a propaganda film over the matter.\n\nNow, however, Heydrich serves a much more sinister cause. A puppet master under a puppet master, on dark strings he bobs to and fro at the behest of Reichsführer der burgundischen-SS Heinrich Himmler to fulfill his will in Germany and abroad.\n\nA trusted and feared servant of Burgundy, nevertheless many have noted an almost dismissive attitude from his master. Heydrich follows behind no matter, earning him a reputation as a toady and yuppy by many. Of course, none would ever dare say so to his face."
 POLITICS_HEYDRICH_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "Reinhard Heydrich is dead, struck down by a mysterious assassin during the valiant struggle for Germany. With the Reichsführer der Deutschen SS now dead, throwing the entire SS gamble into jeopardy, Burgundy's interest in supporting Heydrich's forces has seemingly died with him. As the chain of command begins to break down, with Gruppenführers launching power plays and desperate last stands, all centralized authority inside the German SS has collapsed."

 ###Modifiers###
 HGR_Burgundian_support:0 "Burgundian Support"
 HGR_Burgundian_support_desc:0 "The Führer has decided to, as much as possible, rely upon direct support from the Ordensstaat in the struggle for Germany. Permitted to advance National Socialism in their own country without interference from corrupting elements, the Burgundian-SS exemplify the pinnacle of the Aryan ideal, and their assistance will help in securing total victory for the SS over its many enemies."
 HGR_black_sun_rising:0 "Black Sun Rising"
 #HGR_black_sun_rising_desc:0 "The performance of the German-SS has been, to put it mildly, disappointing in the extreme. Despite the gifted leadership of the Burgundian-SS as well as the provision of vast quantities of equipment from the factories of the Ordensstaat,the SS in Germany have not achieved victory. If this is not rectified presently, Reichsführer Himmler may soon consider if his confidence has been misplaced."
 HGR_stormbrigades:0 "Stormbrigades"
 HGR_Waffen_Support:0 "Waffen-SS Support"
 HGR_Waffen_Support_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS are not Aryan. They are not even German. But they are numerous, merciless, and obedient, and given the small size of the German-SS in comparison to the armies arrayed against the Reichsführer, they are needed. Their numbers will clear the way for more valuable Aryan formations, and shield them from unnecessary loss. And in the end, when the war is won? Those that are still alive can be easily disposed of."
 HGR_for_heydrich:0 "For Heydrich!"
 HGR_for_heydrich_desc:0 "This war is not a Burgundian war. It is not a war for auxiliaries. It is a German war, fought on German soil and the German-SS must lead the charge. United behind The Führer Heydrich, they will advance across their native land, cleansing it of corruption and securing it both for the future of the Aryan race and for the salvation of National Socialism."

 HGR_burgundian_advisors:0 "Burgundian Advisors"
 HGR_burgundian_advisors_desc:0 "Officers from the Burgundian-SS have arrived and been embedded within the military command structure. Freed from base concern over the transitory well being of the German people and instead focused on the long-term salvation of National Socialism, they will act to significantly increase the combat potential of the units they advise."
 HGR_burgundian_commanders:0 "Burgundian Commanders"
 HGR_burgundian_commanders_desc:0 "The corps of advisors from the Ordensstaat have been augmented with additional personnel, allowing them to assume effective command of most of our armed formations. Increases in aggression, determination, and discipline have already been observed, further increasing the combat potential of the units they now command."
 HGR_anti_partisan_brigades:0 "Anti-Partisan Brigades"
 HGR_anti_partisan_brigades_desc:0 "Just like in the last war, as our disciplined legions advance they find partisans in their wake, attacking supply lines, ambushing isolated detachments, and causing trouble. The SS well knows how to deal with partisans, and the fact that in this case they are German makes no difference. To a man, they will be hunted down and eradicated by specialized detachments of the SS, SD, and Einsatzgruppen."
 HGR_your_life_for_heydrich:0 "Your Life for Heydrich"
 HGR_your_life_for_heydrich_desc:0 "It has been claimed by many that it is, in actuality, Reichsführer Himmler who is the true leader of the SS in Germany. Such a lie damages both the motivation of our soldiers and the fidelity of the civilians who occupy our rear areas. To counter this, special care is being taken to ensure that victories both on and off the field of battle are correctly attributed to the one man most responsible for them - The Führer himself."
 HGR_the_final_stand:0 "The Final Stand"
 HGR_the_final_stand_desc:0 "Having determined that the Führer can no longer deliver Germany to the Burgundian-SS, the Ordensstaat's officers have departed, and their shipments of supplies and equipment have ceased. The state has been abandoned. But it has not yet fallen. Every member of the SS in Germany, true Aryans all, will fight to the last bullet, the last man, and the last breath. Meine Ehre heißt Treue!"
 HGR_SS_blitz:0 "The Black Blitzkrieg"
 HGR_SS_blitz_desc:0 "This war has dragged on too long, and the twin fatal dangers of being overwhelmed by enemies and of losing the confidence of the Ordensstaat are growing by the day. The Führer has demanded action. An audacious offensive, leveraging our reserves of men, materiel, and spirit, will recapture the initiative and lead us towards the final victory! It will succeed. It must."
 HGR_SS_commissariat:0 "SS Kommissars"
 HGR_SS_commissariat_desc:0 "To combat the shocking lack of discipline from the many non-Aryan units of the Waffen-SS, the Führer has authorized the establishment of unit-elevated kommissars. Given the power of life and death over their soldiers and tasked with enforcing discipline through any methods necessary, their effect has already been felt in the increased performance of the auxiliaries."
 HGR_deutsch_sicherheitsdienst:0 "Deutsch Sicherheitsdienst"
 HGR_deutsch_sicherheitsdienst_desc:0 "In an attempt to address recent resorts of ill discipline, insubordination, and recklessness amongst the Waffen-SS auxiliaries, the Führer has assigned additional resources to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and ordered increased oversight of their formations. A positive side effect of this expansion is a corresponding increase in the SD's cryptographic capability."
 HGR_heydrichjugend:0 "Die Heydrichjugend"
 HGR_heydrichjugend_desc:0 "With the survival of the race at stake, every German is needed, and this is just as true of the children of Aryans as it is for Aryans themselves. Created in the image of the Hitlerjugend the Heydrichjugend, participation in which is mandatory for all German boys, will act as auxiliaries, messengers, porters, and in many other roles besides. In doing so, they will become rapidly accustomed to the particulars of military life, and can thus be rapidly mobilized once they are, inevitably, required to join their fathers in battle."
 HGR_terror_campaign:0 "Terror Campaigns"
 HGR_terror_campaign_desc:0 "In this war for the very survival of the German soul, dissent behind the lines cannot be permitted. Liberals, communists, clergymen, defeatists, and more infest the land, and policing them is not an efficient use of resources. Using lessons learned long ago, security detachments can ensure compliance through the application of brutal reprisals. Demonstrating the swift response that follows any hint of opposition will ensure that such opposition does not occur."
 HGR_burgundian_einsatzgruppen:0 "Burgundian Einsatzgruppen"
 HGR_burgundian_einsatzgruppen_desc:0 "Specialised Einsatzgruppen detachments have suddenly appeared in the territories administered by SS forces. Sent by the Ordensstaat, and tasked with maintaining control in our rear areas through any means that they deem necessary, they will work to enforce order through the strict application of summary judgement on any perceived offenders."
 HGR_idea_mandatory_spartanism:0 "Mandatory Spartanism"
 HGR_idea_mandatory_spartanism_desc:0 "The Führer has announced a radical and transformative change to German society. From top to bottom, the values of the Ordensstaat - discipline, self-improvement, and absolute obedience to higher authority - will now be applied to German society. While not entirely unexpected given the victory of the SS in the Bürgerkrieg, the speed of implementation is leaving many confused. Is there a reason why the Führer requires such rapid implementation?"
 HGR_loyalty_to_himmler:0 "Loyalty to Himmler"
 HGR_loyalty_to_himmler_desc:0 "Without the support received from the Ordensstaat, the many enemies of the SS would likely have already triumphed, and corrupted National Socialism almost beyond repair. As such it has been made clear that the Führer sees Reichsführer Himmler and the Burgundian-SS as the last, best hope for the triumph of the Aryan race, and that any and all demands or impositions from Burgundy should be immediately fulfilled."
 
 ### Focus Tree ### 
 HGR_burgerkreig:0 "Der Bürgerkrieg"
 HGR_burgerkreig_desc:0 "We saw this in our dreams, long ago: the end of the Reich. An apocalyptic storm of fire and blood, scourging the forests and mountains of our home. In its path stands a single man: Reinhard Heydrich, true heir of Hitler and former Reichsführer-SS of Germany. For the sake of the pure race, for the future of the Reich, for glorious salvation - he must win. Heil Heydrich."
 HGR_burgundische_SS:0 "Burgundische-SS"
 HGR_burgundische_SS_desc:0 "The Burgundian SS are the most loyal and true servants of our cause. They alone possess the tripartite qualities of obedience to the Führer, freedom from temptation and absolute purity of blood. Their counterparts in Germany proper are loyal, but have been unduly influenced by feeble Hitlerism, while the Waffen-SS are little more than glorified mercenaries. Only the purest of the pure race are capable of securing victory."
 HGR_a_helping_hand:0 "A Helping Hand"
 HGR_a_helping_hand_desc:0 "In his greatness, Reichsführer Himmler has vowed to shore up our efforts with all the resources at his disposal. Guns, supplies, armor, aircraft, trucks; all that we need and more besides. More importantly, our Aryan brothers have begun to cross the border in a steady stream - one that shall soon become a ceaseless river. The hills of Alsace-Lorraine will echo once more with the march of jackboots."
 HGR_advisor_staff:0 "Advisor Staff"
 HGR_advisor_staff_desc:0 "As Reichsführer Himmler has correctly assessed, the officers at our disposal are not... adequate for our purposes. There are too many factors that make them inherently unreliable: familial ties, material possessions, self-aggrandizement. Officers sourced directly from Ost-Paris, the heart of Burgundy itself, are the cream of the crop, and Himmler has generously agreed to send a number of them to aid us. They will serve in direct advisory roles, as well as keep an eye on the lesser men of the Deutsch-SS."
 HGR_combined_formations:0 "Combined Formations"
 HGR_combined_formations_desc:0 "Ever since its formation, the SS has dominated the battlefields of Europe and beyond. This is due largely to the manner in which their oaths of loyalty tend to override all obstacles: fear, doubt, and so on. The oath serves as a unifying force, creating a comradeship amongst Aryans that transcends mere technicalities. As divisions between Burgundian and German SS units break down, the two shall be intermingled, combining the original German spirit with new Burgundian ideals. The result shall be the purest, most ferocious warriors the Reich has ever seen!"
 HGR_burgundian_leaders:0 "Burgundian Leaders"
 HGR_burgundian_leaders_desc:0 "Now that Burgundian ideals have proliferated amongst our non-Burgundian units, perhaps they will be more amenable to a change in leadership. Our soldiers have primarily been commanded by officers of the Deutsch-SS, but these men do not understand the modern Aryan way of war as Reichsführer Himmler does. His hand-picked officers are already en route to Germany; they will be most welcome in our chain of command."
 HGR_burgundian_knowledge:0 "Burgundian Knowledge"
 HGR_burgundian_knowledge_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and Reichsführer Himmler possesses both in astounding quantities. The Führer's old friend has assured him that he will have any intelligence whatsoever he desires, so long as it pertains to furthering the goals of true National Socialism. With the long-buried secrets of our rivals in our possession, we will hold a considerable edge over the traitors. They cannot hope to pierce the veil so long as Herr Himmler is with us."
 HGR_arms_drives:0 "Arms Drives"
 HGR_arms_drives_desc:0 "While our spirit is naturally sufficient to overcome any obstacle that might bar our path, even the mightiest Aryan warrior cannot wage war without his tools of death. Unfortunately, we lack the industrial base to avoid that situation with certainty. Reichsführer Himmler has acknowledged this fact, and promises us a plentiful supply of arms and ammunition. From whence this bounty comes, we do not know, but guns are guns no matter the maker... though Aryan guns might be preferable, of course."
 HGR_arms_pipeline:0 "Arms Pipeline"
 HGR_arms_pipeline_desc:0 "Fortuitous news on this fine day: Reichsführer Himmler has seen fit to greatly increase the size and frequency of Burgundy's weapons shipments, turning the system of regular deliveries into a steady flow. It is a true mark of Aryan solidarity that he knows so well the needs of his Führer. With so many quality arms available, we shall easily match the industrial output of our foes."
 HGR_hiyo_brittany:0 "Hiyo Brittany"
 HGR_hiyo_brittany_desc:0 "The Bretons might qualify as Aryan physically, but in spirit they are more akin to Jews. All they care for is wealth, and it is no secret that our enemies are likely buying Breton arms. Still, they possess a large and open arms industry. They will quite happily sell to us, and could procure some more exotic equipment that we cannot produce ourselves. Dealing with these greedy pigs disgusts the Führer, but he will not turn away aid when the future of the Reich is at stake. We can easily take back our money once the current war is won."
 HGR_anti_partisanship:0 "Anti-Partisanship"
 HGR_anti_partisanship_desc:0 "Though this be a civil war, it is no different from that which we fought twenty years ago. Then as now, we will assuredly be plagued by partisans and guerilla fighters. Once upon a time, the duty of anti-partisan operations would have fallen to the Einsatzgruppen alone, but their numbers are insufficient. Thus, to assist them, the SD shall be armed and trained for the purpose. They already have extensive practice in dealing with civilian and military dissidents; partisans are no different, save for the fact that they usually shoot back at their oppressors..."
 HGR_for_the_true_fuhrer:0 "For The True Führer"
 HGR_for_the_true_fuhrer_desc:0 "Certain men - such as those degenerates on the other side of the battlefield - think the Führer a puppet. They deride him for accepting assistance from the Ordenstaat, citing it as proof of his treason and iniquity. Those scum will receive their just desserts in due course, but their slander echoes worryingly amongst the populace. To reassure the good people of Germany that he is his own man, the Führer has decreed that we are to take 'special care' in the attribution of our successes. They come from him, his loyal soldiers, and nowhere else."
 HGR_rally_on_heydrich:0 "Rally On Heydrich"
 HGR_rally_on_heydrich_desc:0 "The common people of the Reich have so far been a disappointment to the Führer. They fear our soldiers, resent us for our rightful appropriation of their wealth and are barely trustworthy themselves. This will not do; if Heydrich is to rule, he must be empowered with the channelled energies of the Aryan race. To spread the Führer's pure ideals and save the people from themselves, we should begin drafting them as conscripts and encouraging them to work harder. Once they have been reminded of the Aryan way, they will surely embrace our Führer wholeheartedly."
 HGR_only_for_germany:0 "Only For Germany"
 HGR_only_for_germany_desc:0 "It seems that hostile propaganda is not so easily counteracted. Unsurprising, given the righteously prideful nature of the Aryan mind. Still, we cannot allow misunderstandings about the Führer's purpose to propagate any further. He is loyal first and foremost to National Socialism, the Greater German Reich and the Aryan race - nothing more. The same is true of the SS. Even if they are Burgundian, their Reichsführer is just as dedicated to our ideals as the Führer himself is. Opinions to the contrary will be met appropriately."
 HGR_deutsch_SS:0 "Deutsch-SS"
 HGR_deutsch_SS_desc:0 "The Burgundians are noble allies, exemplars of all that is good and true in the Aryan race. The Waffen-SS are legions without number, disciplined and professional. But neither can win this war for us. This is a German war, fought on German soil. Only the blood of true-born Germans, raised in the heimat, can redeem the Fatherland. This will not be an easy path to walk, but walk it we must."
 HGR_lesser_allies:0 "Lesser Allies"
 HGR_lesser_allies_desc:0 "Most German citizens do not have a positive image of Reichsführer Himmler, despite his good intentions. Unfortunate, but that needn't be a hindrance to us. By sacrificing some of Himmler's goodwill towards us, we have made the Führer more appealing to Germans who are not of the SS. A surprising number of volunteers have come forward to take up arms in his name. No brave soldier shall be turned away in Germany's hour of need; follow us, bold Aryans!"
 HGR_purity:0 "Purity"
 HGR_purity_desc:0 "The association of our Führer with 'treachery' and 'Himmlerite scheming' is patently unfair. Reinhard Heydrich was a dear friend and confidant of the great Adolf Hitler; why would he ever betray Germany? If you would speak of treason, look no further than those self-proclaimed 'Führers' we face! An effeminate liberal, a brown-nosing bureaucrat and a decadent warmonger - are these the true faces of National Socialism? Are they the ones you would throw your weight behind? No! Heydrich, our rightful Führer, is the embodiment of Aryan virtue and the National Socialist ethos. Heed not the words of traitors - believe in Heydrich!"
 HGR_define_german:0 "Define 'German'"
 HGR_define_german_desc:0 "Science makes new discoveries all the time. That fact remains true for racial science. Once, not so long ago, it was said that only Prussians were truly German. Now, as before, our knowledge has expanded. There are more Germans than we previously thought in Europe, even if they have the misfortune of being born in lesser nations such as France or Bohemia. If there are any such individuals within our lands, they must naturally be granted the status of true Germans - and, as is their right, brought into the Deutsche-SS. Aryans of all nations, unite!"
 HGR_volunteer_divisions:0 "Volunteer Divisions"
 HGR_volunteer_divisions_desc:0 "As our Führer's image has become more definitively 'German', more and more of the people are forming up beneath his standard. They long for a Germany that is, above all, strong and secure. As a result, we now have enough manpower to field entire divisions' worth of militia. Though not comparable in quality to the SS or even the Heer, Heydrich's leadership will multiply their strength tenfold."
 HGR_fight_for_whats_right:0 "Fight For What's Right"
 HGR_fight_for_whats_right_desc:0 "Can you not see, fellow Aryans? Do our deeds not satisfy you? The SS is not your enemy! We have always been the stalwart defenders of National Socialism. When conflict exists between us, it is only because some deviant or Jewish puppet wishes it! Is it they who are traitors and renegades, not us. If you would save the Fatherland, if you are a pure-blooded Aryan, then join us! Rebel against your dark masters, or all of you will perish!"
 HGR_for_a_stronger_germany:0 "For A Stronger Germany"
 HGR_for_a_stronger_germany_desc:0 "The factories are not nearly as productive as they should be. Our workers have been far too lax of late. They must be reminded what it is we are fighting for, and the importance of their role in the salvation of the Aryan race. Their artisanship is just as vital to Germany's cause as the soldier's bravery or the pilot's daring. What that means, in simple terms, is: work harder! Harder and faster, not better! You're not Speerites, are you?"
 HGR_for_a_pure_germany:0 "For A Purer Germany"
 HGR_for_a_pure_germany_desc:0 "Armed struggle is our primary concern at this time, but we must not neglect our duty as National Socialists. There are far too many undesirables in Germany, especially within our own holdings. Fifth columnists, clergymen, defeatists... far from an ideal situation. The Führer is deeply troubled and wishes for this situation to be corrected. This is precisely the kind of dirty work that our volunteer divisions would be suited for, given their relative lack of target practice prior to the war."
 HGR_loot_pipeline:0 "Loot Pipeline"
 HGR_loot_pipeline_desc:0 "Those Germans who refuse to join us are no better than their treacherous leaders. In due time, these degenerate swine will receive a harsh and well-deserved punishment, but for now we must settle for appropriating anything of value they possess. The property of traitors is ours by right. They are enemies like any others. The flow of loot will pay for our war effort, and we might even find something immediately useful on occasion."
 HGR_whats_yours_is_ours:0 "What's Yours Is Ours"
 HGR_whats_yours_is_ours_desc:0 "If you have not dedicated your life and possessions to our cause, the Führer simply asks: why? Do you care nothing for the Reich? For your race? It is the duty of all true Aryans to place anything that might be required at the Führer's disposal. Right now, everything is required. You must - you WILL - serve. You will serve and give us what we need, or you will die. Make your choice."
 HGR_Waffen_SS:0 "Waffen-SS"
 HGR_Waffen_SS_desc:0 "Where the Burgundians are unwavering fanatics, and the Deutsche-SS are trueborn sons of Germany, the Waffen are the legions that won us the world. Unscrupulous, merciless, obedient without question - not the perfect soldiers, but the best we can hope for, given the circumstances. With the vast legions of the Waffen-SS under the Führer's command, this senseless war will be put to a quick and decisive end."
 HGR_all_the_sons_of_the_reich:0 "All The Sons Of The Reich"
 HGR_all_the_sons_of_the_reich_desc:0 "An army without scruples is a dangerous thing, but the Führer cannot deny its effectiveness. The lack of racial discrimination in the Waffen-SS is concerning, but true Aryan qualities tend to manifest most readily after battle is joined. Opening up the ranks to anyone within the Reich who wishes to enlist would allow for a certain degree of... unwanted influences, but any impurities will be easily washed away by bloodshed. Doubtless such a show of magnanimity will also endear the Führer to the Reich's more uncertain citizens."
 HGR_recruitment_overdrive:0 "Recruitment Overdrive"
 HGR_recruitment_overdrive_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS has never had difficulties with recruitment. In fact, as a result of recent recruitment drives, they already have several new divisions ready to go. Perhaps this demonstrates a lack of oversight on the part of the previous government, but we shall not turn away highly-trained and well-equipped men. The Führer welcomes all who can prove their Aryan credentials in battle."
 HGR_friends_in_bohemia:0 "Friends In Bohemia"
 HGR_friends_in_bohemia_desc:0 "Our comrades in Bohemia have waited long for this moment. They are among the toughest of the Waffen divisions, hardened by years of battle against partisans and boasting large numbers of thoroughly Germanized Czechs to support us. They are not yet ready to join the battle, but they have begun shipping large quantities of weapons to us, all with Bohemian stamps of quality. This material support is the minimum that the Führer expects, but is most welcome regardless."
 HGR_over_the_mountains_high:0 "Over The Mountains"
 HGR_over_the_mountains_high_desc:0 "Finally! The Bohemian SS have assembled their divisions and are making their way through the mountains of the Sudetenland, ready for battle. The trickle of men is slow, as they have had to sneak through enemy lines disguised as refugees, but even these few men will make a difference in our struggle for the Reich."
 HGR_allies_in_ostland:0 "Allies In Ostland"
 HGR_allies_in_ostland_desc:0 "The leader of the Ostland SS, Friedrich Jeckeln, is little more than a glorified bandit. However, he knows his place and has recognized Heydrich as the rightful Führer, despite their personal animosity. He is currently too preoccupied to actually throw his men into the fight - not that he would if it were possible - but can ship spare weapons to us. A meager offering, but guns are guns."
 HGR_the_porous_border:0 "The Porous Border"
 HGR_the_porous_border_desc:0 "It was not only the SS within Germany itself that were preparing for the clash of Führers. All across the Reich, Waffen divisions spent years planning in secret for the day when Heydrich would face his rivals. Now the horn of war is sounded, and they flow into our realm like converging streams, swelling the ranks of the rightful Führer's army. Soon our numbers will dwarf our enemies!"
 HGR_deutsch_warriors_union:0 "Deutsch Warriors"
 HGR_deutsch_warriors_union_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS are the best of the best, and they know it. They were famously tough and skilled when fighting for money alone; with the added motivation of fighting for the rightful Führer, they are all but unstoppable. Their sheer vigor and ferocity in combat is a sight to behold. No amount of corrupt, backwards Heer divisions can hope to stop our pan-Germanic legions."
 HGR_purity_where_we_can_find_it:0 "Purity Where We Can Find It"
 HGR_purity_where_we_can_find_it_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS almost seems more non-German than not. This might concern lesser men, but not the Führer. As the arch-didact of National Socialism, it is he alone who can decide who is and is not Aryan. Purity comes in many forms: sometimes physical, sometimes mental, sometimes spiritual. Though there is obviously still a clear line between 'Aryan' and 'non-Aryan', the matter of 'honorary Aryan' is a different matter entirely. It is a great honor indeed, and the potential to earn it may rest in any man's heart, should he prove willing and noble enough..."

 HGR_a_dark_wave_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS have endured tremendous casualties fighting for the Führer, but this has not weakened them. Quite the contrary; with every one of their number who dies at enemy hands, they find one more reason to continue fighting. They have become inured to pain and hardship, even more so than before the war began. The fact that many are non-Germans and are fighting their so-called 'oppressors' might also be a factor... but such worries are for lesser men. They will always obey in the end."

 HGR_the_swarm_desc:0 "As the war drags on, the quality of the available Waffen divisions has plummeted. We simply do not have enough trained recruits to replace their losses without diluting their combat effectiveness. With so many of their best now dead, the SS has transformed from a highly-disciplined modern army to a horde that relies more on weight of numbers than superior training. The Führer has made disparaging comparisons to the Red Army, but they still hold the line, and that is all he would ask of them."

They have little tolerance for the indolence and weakness of civilians, and a culture of brutal elitism has developed following the degradation of their traditions due to casualties. No longer do they wait for reinforcements; instead, their recruits tend to be drawn from the very people they are in the process of liberating. The image of a Waffen-SS squad rounding up the men of a village and forcing them to choose between service or death is a shockingly common one, but this is the Germanic way of war. The people must learn to understand that the Waffen-SS is the true expression of Aryan militarism: harsh, cold and pitiless."

Ordinary officers, especially Heydrich's own men, are almost completely unable to exert any control over the Waffen divisions, especially the non-Germans. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formation of a Waffen-SS Kommissar corps. Similar to the National Socialist Leadership Officers, these men will be elevated from their own units and given the power of life and death over officers and enlisted men alike. This way, we shall have reliable political officers who are personally loyal to the Führer and face no language barrier when dealing with the men."

 #### EVENTS ###
 
 heydrich_successor.1.t:0 "Open Fire"
 heydrich_successor.1.desc:0 "The day began quietly. At dawn, a group of students gathered around the Central SS Office in Bonn. Using typical student chants and yelling about democracy and vaguely protesting the newfound influence of the Schutzstaffel on the government, the crowd seemed to grow throughout the day. It had to be one of the greatest marches in weeks, at least since Heydrich had been declared successor. It was not surprising, ultimately.\n\nYes, the students protested all authoritarian rule, but the common German family would simply live if their way of live did not seem to be threatened. Heydrich threatened that. The prospect of truly living a Burgundian life, becoming a Spartan, dying en masse for the state. No. That was for Jews and Slavs, not an upstanding, reformist Aryan. So for the first time in what seemed like forever, middle class families began protesting. Timidly, and at first in small number, but they grew and grew. By midday, there must have been a thousand people. They went on, and on, chanting and chanting, and it finally died down a bit. A few departed.\n\nAs soon as they did, three shots rang out from the SS building. Snipers. Three men began screaming. One went silent. The other quieted to a whimper. Three more shots, two more brief screams. Somewhere, a rapid fire gun went off. There was a stampede. A secondary school student was trampled trying to run. Dozens wailed. This was not the plan. This was not the plan. They had never opened fire on a crowd, not like this.\n\nThe square was silent, besides the remaining few whimpers. Everybody had either fled or been shot."

 heydrich_successor.2.desc:0 "Hitler, Fuhrer of the Reich, stood up to the podium and had a coughing fit. When he was done, he looked up at the crowd, peered at them for a second, and then looked down at a script placed on the podium beforehand.\n\n"I reaffirm the capability of my appointed successor..."\n\nHitler looked dazed, and asked the bodyguard next to him what that name was.\n\n"Heydrich, mein Fuhrer."\n\nHe said it was if he had to say that frequently, without the usual fear when addressing the Fuhrer.\n\n"-the capability of my appointed successor, Heydrich, as a Fuhrer in what will be my last and most unfortunate absence. The man has served me loyally and will continue to serve the Reich. The man is not only a vanguard of the Aryan race, but a true enemy of Jews the world over. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Where - I... Thank you."\n\nHitler stumbled off the stage, to the confusion of the crowd."

They whisper to each other, dreading what they do not know yet still, with horrifying accuracy, understand.\n\nFear lives in the soldiers, who eye each other with suspicion and murder. They see the battles and bombs turned inwards on themselves. They see their own mangled bodies trampled underfoot by the children who will fight the war they could not.\n\nFear lives in Heydrich. Nestled close to his heart, it beats in tandem composing a vile rhythm. All Heydrich knows is fear. He fears the children. He fears the soldiers. He fears his own fear. His preparations cannot alleviate his terror. They embolden it."

They came in a flurry through official and unofficial channels, flooding the Reichstag with an contradictory sense of liberation and fear. Bureaucrats and politicians milled around like a dying haze. There was little else to do.\n\nThe new Fuhrer had not bothered to give a pompous speech or issue a formal announcement. A new Germany was in the making and he couldn't afford to be distracted by the egos of irrelevant relics from a decadent era. They served no benefit towards the creation of a true Aryan state and so they did not matter.\n\nThis new truth took slightly longer to reach the collective indignation of the Reichstag. The bloated corpse of a dead republic clung so desperately to its existence, as though it hadn't already ceased to exist three decades ago. Inexorably, however, reality fell to the floor for all to see."

 heydrich_successor.5.desc:0 "The men moved quickly, but not hastily. They were prepared, experienced. Every action was taken with cold, surgical precision. Thousands of them, constructed like clockwork, made their simultaneous moves.\n\nThe SS had a knack for destruction. They sliced up wires, immolated documents, and brutalized trusted messengers. Every effort was made to blind the prying eyes, amputate the groping hands, and deafen the eavesdropping ears of Heydrich's opposition. By the end of the day, orders and communiques descended into confusion and convulsion.\n\nHeydrich's own methods of communication stood intact, of course. Information passed smoothly between his commanders and men. They were united in purpose and thought. The traitorous rabble, distinguishable only by their specific brand degeneracy, could not help but feel awe at their own isolation."

 heydrich_successor.6.desc:0 "Free trade was often seen as a sign of opening up to the world around a nation, expanding economic and cultural horizons.\n\nThis was anything but. Every night, a caravan of trucks approached the German border from Burgundy. The drivers could hardly be seen through the tinted windows, but a keen-sighted observer would universally see men wearing dark sunglasses wearing heavy coats. They transported unknown cargo. Nuclear weaponry? Poison for the masses? Toiletries? No one knew, especially because the usually quite thorough border guards waved anybody in the particular Burgundian truck without a second thought. And the trucks just kept on coming. For the first time in forever, Burgundy was opening up. They were sending their terrible cargo into Germany.\n\nWorse still, when the trucks finally entered the Reich proper, they always ended up at Schutzstaffel offices and the cities with the most support for the newly appointed successor. Soon enough, there were reports of extravagant SS celebrations, with specially made Burgundian champaign and some of whatever cargo was in those trucks. Cities supporting Heydrich saw an ever-so-slight uptick in economic performance, just at the moment those trucks began to drive in. Someone west of the border was playing favorites."

 HGR.1.desc:0 "The Wehrmacht was confused at the start of the civil war. With dozens of different orders coming from different commands ordering them to open fire on other army units, the military largely fell into anarchy, matching their home nation. The SS, however, largely avoided this chaos. Already having orders to prepare for battle, and having armed themselves in preparation for this battle for the fate of Germania, the SS was prepared for the struggle, and almost unanimously fell under command of Reinhard Heydrich. Many Wehrmacht garrisons suspected to harbor sympathies against Heydrich were gunned down before they realized that 'Bestellung 88' had arrived, an order authorizing the SS to annihilate any possible rebels before they even come to arms.\n\nSS units have largely centralized around their bases in Danzig or in Elsaß-Lothringen, close to Burgundy, where arms and supplies have already begun flowing in to assist them with their struggle. And although Burgundy has officially claimed neutrality in the struggle so far, all know that Heydrich has Himmler's backing."

 HGR.2.t:0 "Burgundian Aid"
 HGR.2.desc:0 "Supplies found themselves from Burgundy into the hands of the SS even before the civil war broke out, and after they only intensified in number. With Heydrich being known as little more than Himmler's puppet, it was little surprise that he received massive amounts of aid from Himmler's personal nation in Burgundy. Volunteers were plentiful as well, and multiple SS units from Burgundy also found themselves in Germany, fighting on behalf of Heydrich. The other pretenders have all protested the move, claiming Burgundy is, in practice, invading Germany, but their whining won't matter much when they're dead."

As anthems of the SS and the Nazi state played thunderously, Heydrich commanded his troops to form walls in front of the Volkshalle while he took the podium behind them.\n\nIn the following speech, Heydrich emphasized how his new order would 'restore the Aryan blood' and 'return the ideals that made our Reich the strongest to us', among other statements from the Butcher of Prague. Soon after, Heinrich Himmler began his speech, declaring German-Burgundian relations 'restored with an alliance to destroy degeneracy where it stands' among other things.\n\nWhile German-Burgundian relations have soared, the rest of the world has reacted in sharp condemnation, looking on in horror. The United States and Japan have announced a buildup of their nuclear assets, as well as full mobilization of their armed forces, with several allied countries following suit."

That includes Albert Speer, who has acquired a reputation as being a leading democratic figure within the ever changing and factional Reich.\n\nHeydrich has already begun the search for Speer, sending out loyal SS divisions to hunt down the man and ordering all available Gestapo units nationwide to keep an eye out in case Speer is spotted or if he manages to mysteriously emerge.\n\nIt is clear, however, that this hunt will not be easy and that Speer has taken many precautions to hide himself in the case of an event such as this. In addition, the already raucous students have taken to supporting Speer and are already resisting us at every turn. No matter, for we shall successfully deal with any and all traitors within the Reich, bringing about a golden age."

With our failure at further expansion beyond the borders of what loyal areas had flocked to us, alongside low morale and high anarchy within our nation, Himmler has effectively, and permanently, relieved Heydrich of his duties by having him killed through the use of an assassination.

They have been sent running or left dead in the wake of this bloody strife, and our Gestapo will find the ones who remain. Victory has been achieved in the name of the Fatherland, with gracious help from Burgundy and Himmler, yet there is one final obstacle to our quest of retaking Germany, and reshaping the Aryan spirit with it. That would be Speidel, and his former commander Rommel. At the beginning of our march to return Germany to the correct ideals, he launched a coup to 'protect Germania from the worst'. Now that we have completed our victory, however, his little game will come to an end. Speidel has been ordered to surrender his weapons and re-integrate into Germany properly. Even though it is clear that his decadent ideals have corrupted himself enough to refuse this, perhaps some more... rational thought from his generals may clear things up very quickly. But if he does not stand down to the rightful Führer, then we will take action, and punish the degenerate Germanians with their decadent ideals. Quickly."

Although the Welthauptstadt has been corrupted by greed, degeneracy, and chaos, the rightful Führer, Heydrich, will quickly ensure that these practices come to an end.\n\nThe end of the long and brutal German Civil War would normally be a joyous time for Germany, but the streets of Germania are empty. Citizens have locked themselves in their homes in fear, with some of the more daft Germanians even attempting Communist-like partisan attacks. These attackers, however, were made short work of, and the partisans we captured have been executed publicly to set an example. The new rules the German public must follow to ensure the Aryan ideals thrive shall be met, finally, and the rightful Führer now stands with a united Reich we have been fighting for."

To this end, we have been proven correct: Speidel has predictably declared that Germania will never fall to the forces of Himmler and his puppet, and has called all Germanians to fight against us. Even if our people have raised us concerns on the future state of Germania, whether it will survive the fighting, we are confident enough in our SS to purge the pure capital belonging to the Aryan citizen of any degenerates while ensuring unity and peace remains. The important news, most of all, is that Speidel does not wish to end his little charade.\n\nThe Führer will fix that."

As more and more of the little remaining infrastructure becomes victim to various war efforts, food and supplies no longer move around, and the famine only gets worse, disease quickly following along with it.\n\nThis is the true beginning of what people are calling the German Anarchy, and the worst has yet to come."

They've just landed at the Reichstag, sent on Himmler's orders to see you. We did not know."\n\nHeydrich stared at him for a few more seconds before raising his eyes to the rooftops, past the milling SS men and the smoke and the buildings and towards the towering Volkshalle a few miles away.\n\nAnd without a word he began walking towards it."

Already they had sectioned off half of the plaza — space enough for exactly four helicopters to safely land if need be — to themselves and their single vehicle. In front of it stood Werner Grothmann, still as a statue in a perfect SS uniform. Heydrich could smell toad as he approached, but said nothing. Grothmann was close to Himmler, and worthy of respect for that, if nothing else.\n\n"Heil Himmler! Heil mein Führer!" Grothmann shouted above the helicopter with a proud salute, which Heydrich returned in kind. He could tell immediately that Grothmann was searching for a reaction to the order of names, but if he wanted one then he'd have been disappointed. Heydrich was above the petty politics and ambitions of junior officers.\n\nGrothmann folded his hands behind his back and looked to the Reichstag. "I come to offer you my congratulations, mein Führer. Herr Himmler has decided that you are to be... informed of several things," he said as an aide handed him a sealed red folder, "Welcome to the inner circle."\n\nHeydrich nodded and reached for the folder, but frowned as Grothmann shook his head and hid it behind his back.

Instead the man just sat and stared at Heydrich's face, blinking exactly seven times every minute — besides one where he only blinked six — in order to see if the puppet Führer reacted with horror of awe.\n\nInstead he got nothing, most likely as he expected.

However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."
