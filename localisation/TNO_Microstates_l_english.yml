POLITICS_John_XXIII_DESC:0 "His Holiness John XXIII, baptized Angelo Maria Roncalli, is the current pope of the Catholic Church, vicar of Christ on Earth and spiritual leader to the millions of Catholics of the globe. Born into a family of sharecroppers in northern Italy, Angelo joined the Franciscan Order: once ordained as a man of faith, young Angelo showed his talent as an administrator, rapidly climbing the priestly ranks. Serving in WWI as a chaplain in the Regio Esercito, Angelo later became an emissary of the Holy See: when WWII began, Angelo, now a bishop, was in Bulgaria, secretly helping the local Jews escape persecution and flee to the Levant.\n\nAfter the war, Angelo was recalled to Rome and elevated to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Pius XII. In 1958, when Pius XII died, the Church was bereft of the man who had led it across the turbulent years of WWII. Bitterly divided between opposing political factions, the Conclave opted to elect an uncharismatic, old Pope who'd do next to nothing during his pontificate, allowing the cliques of the Church to continue their squabbles: thus, they picked the humble former Nuncio, Angelo Roncalli, and they couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nPope John XXIII proved himself to be an energetic and charismatic reformer; despite his doctrinal traditionalism, the new Pope became a harsh critic of the fascist regimes of Europe, speaking in favour of democracy and denouncing those in the Church who collaborated with oppressive policies. As a symbol of hope, inspiring even non-Catholics, he became universally loved among the populace, with the Italian people even nicknaming him "the Good Pope" despite his frictions with the fascist government. However, the Church John XXIII leads is still divided, and with his age growing and his health declining, no one knows whether the path set forth by the Good Pope will be followed by his flock - perhaps, only God, in his infinite wisdom, knows."

POLITICS_CHARLOTTE_DESC:0 "Princess Charlotte Louise Juliette Grimaldi is the current ruler of the Principality of Monaco, but most days she really wishes she wasn't. Her path to rulership was fraught with strife and conflict since her very birth in 1898: an illegitimate child of prince Louis II, who had no siblings nor legitimate children, she was only made the heir apparent (despite this being against Monegasque law) to prevent the Principality from being inherited by the legal successor, a German prince, in order to avoid an international crisis between France and the German Empire.\n\nThe young princess married a French count: however, as he was homosexual, her marriage was unhappy and she had a well known affair before finally divorcing. During WWII, when Monaco was occupied by Mussolini's troops, Charlotte asked prince Louis II to let her renounce her succession rights, allowing her son Rainier to become the heir. Prince Louis refused this proposal, as Rainier was a well known sympathizer for the Allied cause, and with the Axis triumphing across the world, the Prince feared that having him as the heir would seal the doom of the tiny nation.\n\nDespite the Axis's final victory, doom did not come: Monaco bent itself to the the new European overlords, and when Louis died in 1949, Charlotte became Princess. However, her role in politics was very limited, and most power ended in the hands of a clique of ministers and administrators revolving around her son, the ever more energetic Rainier. With Monaco growing ever richer and more glamorous, as foreign stars and businessmen come to squander their wealth in its beaches and its Casino, the Princess sits in her palace, gazing at the luxurious hotels and rivieras. To some, a speck on the European map, an oversight of history; to others, a wonderland of excess and refined hedonism; to the Princess, Monaco will always be a cage, no matter how gilded."

POLITICS_Leonida_Suzzi_Valli_DESC:0 "His Excellence Leonida Suzzi Valli is the newly elected Captain Regent of the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, the tiny republic nested on the Monte Titano, in the Apennine mountains. A mathematics and physics high school teacher by trade, Valli also later became involved in the political life of the Republic, pursuing a diplomatic career and becoming the envoy of San Marino to Italy and Germany during WWII. Despite resenting fascism and its negative effects on the once free and democratic life of his small nation, Valli was forced into joining the Partito Fascista Sammarinese in order to continue his political career.\n\nAfter WWII, Valli continued his political activity, despite the country being dominated by the fascists and the powerful Gozi family, which placed its members in the position of Captain Regent multiple times. Over the years, Valli became the most prominent members of the opposition against the Gozi, finally managing to become Captain Regent with the goal of reverting the undemocratic and illiberal policies of the past and restore a semblance of freedom to the ancient Republic.\n\nDespite having its ancient tradition of democracy tarnished by the stain of fascism, San Marino developed greatly in the last few decades, and new troubles afflict the old republic. With industrialization and urbanization increasing ever faster, the economy of the country depends more and more from Italy, chipping away at San Marino's prized independence, and the workers and proles are becoming more and more resentful towards the institutions of the Republic. Now, Valli and his allies have to navigate this tangled web of problems ensnaring the Monte Titano, being careful not to draw too much unwanted attention from their Italian neighbors."
