 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC:0 "Since there has been a "Free France", Charles de Gaulle has stood at its helm. For more than 20 years, de Gaulle has led the last remaining Free French in a desperate and drawn out battle for survival against the greatest odds. He was once a division commander in the army of the Fourth French Republic, keen to bring reform to their forces. His attempts were made too late however and France quickly fell the Wehrmacht. Keen to continue the fight, de Gaulle rallied what support he had and headed to Africa. Although the fighting continued, de Gaulle fared little better here. Over the years, the forces of Free France were relentlessly pursued across Africa until only the tiniest strip of what had once been the colonial possessions of the French Republic remained. Through it all, de Gaulle has been both a great boon and a great curse for those that still follow the dream of a Free France. The man is utterly convinced of "La Libération" to the point where it is hard not to share in the aging leader's sheer enthusiasm. Sadly, his conviction is paired with an extreme stubbornness. de Gaulle is unwilling to end the unpopular military government, despite the fact that his generals are usually too busy working as mercenaries for other West African nations and even the Germans in Zentralafrika. de Gaulle soldiers on, making his radio addresses and inspecting the troops each day, seemingly convinced that it will be part of the start of their journey home. He has even promised elections, although with the deadline drawing ever nearer, some are uncertain if de Gaulle is willing to even surrender that much to the people. Nor has he properly acknowledged the generals that wish to see him gone, and the fact they would be quite capable of having their wish fulfilled. de Gaulle must perhaps realise his situation and be willing to make compromises, should he wish to see his homeland ever again."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC1:0 "Everywhere outside of Free France. De Gaulle is seen as a failure. He failed to rouse his country from its darkest point. He failed to assist in the war effort. He failed France. But that is just outside Free France. In Free France he is a hero, albeit a fading one. Nobody can deny his charisma and optimism, and he has used it to the greatest extent he can in the tiny empire he has carved for himself. In his France, through all the troubles it goes through, they still march through the streets, singing La Marseillaise and chanting "Liberté, égalité, fraternité"\n\nIf there is one thing anybody can give credit to Charles De Gaulle for, its that he never gives up on France, and he won't till he takes his last breath."

 free_france.3.desc:0 "The last protest left a mark on the french and belgian exiles. While it is true that De Gaulle promsied his elections for before 1965, he doesn't seem enclined to follow his promise. Pierre Mnedès-France with the help of multiple thinkers, both gaullists, nouvelle-vaguistes and socialists, wrote a declaration to be published and sold on the open market. Press is free in Free France, and the declaration quickly spread around the homes of the Free French.\n\nDe Gaulle's cabinet has seen this as a threat to his leadership, but Charles de Gaulle doesn't see any harm in free press and people wanting more freedom, a cause of frustation in his high command."

 free_france.4.desc:0 "Whilst we are no stranger to death as we strive to endure and overcome our temporary exile, the Free French people are today united in mourning following the announcement of the death of General Louis Napoléon Bonaparte, styled as Napoléon VI. A respected General, Prince Napoléon had been out in the field inspecting one of our forward positions along the Ghanaian border when radio difficulties led to an inability to warn the stationed garrison of an impending German bombing raid. Severely wounded, the General was carried to an emergency field hospital where he later died during surgery.\n\nPretender to the French Imperial Throne and veteran of the Second World War, General Bonaparte became highly respected by the Free French Army for his personal involvement in the war efforts, and came to act as an unofficial figurehead through his attempts to keep our beleaguered people united. Already Charles de Gaulle has declared that the General shall receive a full state funeral, causing controversy with Republican elements of our government, and vowed the body would be reinterred in France upon the Libération. General Bonaparte leaves behind his eleven year old son Charles, who will now take up his father's mantle as head of the Imperial House of France."

The main topic will of course be the elections, but also the restoration of the Constitution, which has beet suspended during the start of the exile.\n\nWhile agreeing on the matter of the constitution and the status of the belgian citizens, tension arose when the elections were brought to light. Charles de Gaulle stand strong with his idea of a strong ruler, someone who can represent the french spirit and have power over most decisions. Mendès-France tends to want a state with more power to the people, not as much as in a socialist state, but with a stronger civilian-elected parliament which can override the decisions of the president. Either way, the subject of the elections cannot be glossed over and De Gaulle has to voice his ruling."

Quickly following the realisation of the lie, massive protest started to appear all around Abidjan, and the Palais du Gouverneur is directly targeted by them. Projectiles are thrown at the windows, cars and infrastructure were set on fire, a scene that was totally alien to the Free French, something they haven't seen since the socialists uprisings of the mid-1930s.\n\nThe cabinet is panicking, but the high command is waiting for an order coming from the top.

This comes as a surprise to most politicians as it didn't seem like De Gaulle would finally agree, and party ruler from all the spectrum are hastly preparing their campaign to the presidency.\n\nWith this new republic comes a new constitution. The constitution of the Third Republic is seen as a complete failure, and the new administration will, at the start of their term, have to decide the constitution of the Fourth French Republic. Of course De Gaulle wouldn't let this go on without him, the only condition for the elections is that he needs to be present during the writing of the constitution and to have a say in what goes in or not.\n\nIn the end most of the exiled are happy with this decision, as they can now finally decide their fate and their leadership."

For this first election, the obvious choice for them is the 20 years standing ruler of Free France, Charles de Gaulle, which means that a lot of work had to be put to restore his image in the eyes of the french people.\n\nHis campaign was based on an enormous focus on the goal of the Libération, and how De Gaulle is the only one truely capable of carrying the Plan to its end. Of course this resonated with the long time gaullists, but with the nostalgic of the Résistance too. Strangely, this also pleased the belgian exiles, which status in Free France is still in question and which only waits for their return to the Plat-Pays. In the end the campaign was surprisingly effective, making the Général a strong contender in the election.

This wasn't followed by a regular speech, Jean Gabin, standing on the podium of the scene, stayed silent for nearly 10 minutes, as the lights turned off and a movie started to roll behind him. Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, this film which takes inspiration from how the french lived in the 30s, was a short story about a policeman who were fired after a botched investigation, and moved from Paris to Corsica, a place from which he thought he could regain his reputation and become a cop again and go back to Paris to teach them how to do things right. However, during his "exile" it seems that he just became more bitter with time, eventually becoming the very person he fought years ago, a bandit fueled only by vangeance, forgetting his humanity and his morality.\n\nAfter this projection, the speech of Jean Gabin was of little importance to the press. Indeed, it was very obvious to a lot of intellectuals that this piece was just an allegory for De Gaulle and how his leadership drifted far from the ideals he defended 20 years ago. "Most of the leaders of the Nouvelle Vague party didn't know the life before Free France. The stories they heard, told by their parent, was most likely embellished with time, and as the young often do, they blindly believe in a false utopia" said the Journal de la France Libre, one of the most popular Free French newspaper."

A great part of the population, on the other hand, have to listen to the faithful Radio Française Libre, the main radio station of the Free French forces and the major mean of communication between the press, the government and the exiled.\n\nMultiple topics were tackled in this debate. The status of the Free French army, what will the new consitution be and the future of the Libération are the main contested points between the two candidates. Pierre Mendès-France stays firm on his ideals and his relationship with the Résistance, and his anti-De Gaulle rhetoric, while Maurice Schumann takes a more moderate approach on the politics of Free France, and while he doesn't agree with the Général's politics, he doesn't necessarely wants to amend ties with the Résistance, and wants to focus on their relationship with the OFN, and more specifically, with the United States.\n\nIn the end, 15 000 people watched the debate live on television, and 980 000 peoples, which only represent a quarter of the exiled population, have listened to the debate.

In some streets, the protest have grown up to 50 000 people, and the military police had to be sent to a few of them where the clashes between Ivorians and Exiles became too violent. After 3 days of protest, the leader of the Ivorian Democratic Front, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, was finally invited to the Palais du Gouverneur to talk with De Gaulle, but it seems like hours of discussion has led to nothing more than a promise of status-quo between the two people.\n\nIn this time where the Free French are eagerly waiting for the return of democracy, it seems like the Ivorians will not see the light of it for a long time."
