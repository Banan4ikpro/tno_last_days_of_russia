USA.1705.t:0 "The Yockey Inauguration"
USA.1705.d:0 "The nation stands in shock, riot police line the streets of Washington D.C., and Francis Parker Yockey climbs the steps of the United States Capitol building to be sworn in as President of the United States. Flanked by uneasy Secret Service agents, the new leader of the National Progressive Party strides to the podium, brimming with confidence. Against all odds, his plans have come to fruition, and America awaits his words.\n\nThose surrounding the podium are of less distinction than expected for an inauguration of such importance; the R-Ds have boycotted his swearing in, and much of his own party refuses to attend. Foreign observers are also notably sparse, with the exception of a small delegation from the Reich, making the guest list mostly composed of his most avid supporters. Lois de Lafayette Washburn, Yockey's campaign manager, smiles for the cameras as the enigmatic donor Harold Keith Thompson deftly avoids them. The newly sworn in Vice President Louis Byers shakes hands and signs autographs for brown-shirted well-wishers, reveling in his candidate's victory, while freshman representatives Willis Carto and Fred Huntley make conversation and Admiral John Crommelin's imperious gaze scans the crowd for signs of danger.\nThe crowd is composed in three parts. First, there are those whose sympathies lie with the underdog candidate who has overcome decades of struggle to reach this moment and wish to see America molded in his vision. Second, those who have turned out to exercise their First Amendment rights, fearing that they may be stripped away before the next inauguration. Finally, a thin line of Capitol Police divides the two groups. Shouts of protest and acclamation rise over each other, struggling to be heard.\n\nAs Yockey ascends, the din only grows into a storm of discontent, rising with the wind that flutters through the pages of his speech. The chief justice extends the book to the speaker; Imperium, Yockey's masterpiece of geopolitics and culture theory.\n\nIgnoring the contemptuous look of the defeated judge, one hand upon the book, he repeats the oath.\n\nThe President retracts his hand, turns towards the crowd, and begins to speak."

#Leader Description
POLITICS_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "Francis Parker Yockey is a man that few ever expected to be clothed in the powers of the Presidency. Now, however, after one of the most contentious elections in American history, an outspoken fascist sits in the White House. Originally an author and philosopher, Yockey became enthralled with the authoritarian and fascist movements occurring across the world during the 1930s. He took a particular interest in the works of Adolf Hitler while studying to become a lawyer, embracing the Nazi ideals of anti-semitism and ultranationalism. Following the publication of his self-described magnum opus, "Imperium: the Philosophy of History and Politics", Yockey fathered a new movement in American politics by founding an ultra-far right section of the National Progressive Party. Originally calling their wing of the NPP the "All-American National Vanguard", Yockey and his followers were quickly abhorred by the rest of the American political spectrum and simply dubbed "Yockeyites". However, through the failures of his enemies and sheer providence, his faction now stands triumphant over the American political system.\n\nThe election of Yockey as President has stirred more than a few rats from the woodwork. In many cities across America, mainly in the South, it is not uncommon to see men wearing the hooded white robes of the Klu Klux Klan. Similarly, there is open talk of repealing landmark Civil Rights legislation of the past 20 years. Increasingly common lynchings of Black Americans go unnoticed and uninvestigated. In short, hate is being normalized across the United States, and many within and without the political establishment are terrified where this authoritarian wave might go.\n\nYockey, despite being the leader of the most powerful free nation on Earth, has been unclear and contradictory on his opinions of liberty. Many believe that, regardless of whatever outward show he makes of keeping American liberties intact, he is still a fascist, and will do everything he is able to strengthen the office of President. Yockey himself simply decries "culture-distorters" and claims to safeguard Western Civilization. Exactly what Yockey is protecting it from remains unclear, but with a cross and a star-spangled cloak, Francis Parker Yockey sits in the Oval Office, ready to execute his will upon America."
