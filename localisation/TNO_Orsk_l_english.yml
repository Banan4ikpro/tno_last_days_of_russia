 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_OSKAR_DIRLEWANGER_DESC:0 "The feared bandit king of the Urals, the pirate of Orsk, the rapist of Russia. All names used to describe one man. The mere mention of his name will turn man to child to a weeping mess on the ground. Whole villages burn before him while their women and children march out at gunpoint. Surrounded by his Hunnic entourage, it is none other than Oskar Dirlewanger, who personally leads "hunts" against the Russian citizenry unfortunate enough to call the Southern Urals their home.\n\nFrom an SS officer serving on the Eastern Front, to the head of a savage tribe held together only by their barbaric desire for spoil, one thing has remained consistent throughout; his sadistic and terrifyingly brutal strategies. Closely following Hitler's rise through membership in the Nazi party, Dirlewanger's rape of a fourteen year old in 1934 sent him to a concentration camp, a predicament only his extensive connections got him out of. Volunteering in the Waffen-SS in 1939, Dirlewanger and his brigade raped, burned, and slaughtered their way through Russia, committing crimes of which even the lightest being disgustingly sadistic. Dirlewanger and his bandits remained on the AA Line until the 1950s, when fate turned for him once again. When Russia finally united once more to force out the Nazi invaders, Dirlewanger was more than ready to fight this enemy again. It was the break between the Wehrmacht and the SS that would define Dirlewanger. When Speidel came to disarm his division, Dirlewanger struck back hard. Opening fire on fellow Germans, his band escaped from captivity into the Russian winter, presumed dead by Berlin.\n\nYears later, it is clear he is all too alive. Leading his ideal life, the epitome of sadistic pleasure, his German soldiers some of the best equipped and hardened devils in Russia, he rapes and pillages to his heart's content. Now he turns his eye on two places in particular: the city of Orenburg and the heart of the Black Mountain, two locations he is sure he would benefit greatly from, and enjoy even more, razing to ruin."
 POLITICS_FRITZ_SCHMEDES_DESC:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger is dead. His infamous brigade, however, still limps on, splintered and chaotic and non-functional, but still there all the same. Only one was fit to try and keep the unit together, and that man is Fritz Schmedes. Exiled to the brigade by Heinrich Himmler himself after a dispute, Schmedes never wanted to be here, but here he was all the same. When the brigade went from a German military unit to the force of wild bandits it is known as now, Schmedes adapted, and he became just as monstrous and ruthless as any other, perhaps just to survive, perhaps because deep down he was always as bad as the rest. Now, with the bandit king dead and the brigade in anarchy, Schmedes leads the crippled remnants that are still loyal. Still, as more men desert each week, more splinter bandit companies form, and the outsiders prepare to take their revenge, it seems as though his efforts are as doomed as Dirlewanger."
 POLITICS_STEVE_DESC:0 "No last name, just Steve\n\nA Community College Student from Minnesota\n\nHe's very lost\n\nNot all who wander are lost- but Steve is.\n\nSteve is very lost\n\n\n\nStve has hypothermia."
 LEADER_FRITZ_SCHMEDES_DESC:0 "Fritz Schmedes was a good German. He was a loyal National Socialist. He served the Reich and the Aryan race with all his heart, and yet it was all for naught. No matter how loyal one is to Germany, a dispute with Heinrich Himmler himself means you will be punished. Fritz Schmedes, loyal son of Germany, was banished from his normal duties to serve under Oskar Dirlewanger in the infamous Dirlewanger Brigade. When the brigade was lost in the war against Russia and exiled into the harsh wilderness, Schmedes persevered, and even now as the once-loyal German soldiers pillage and raid like the common bandits they were conscripted to fight, Schmedes lives on. His seething anger and resentment for being put here manifests itself in the same unspeakable cruelties the rest of the brigands are well-known for, and even if not by choice, Schmedes is a loyal son of Germany no longer. He is a monster like the rest."

Dirlewanger has led us to victory time and time again, against the weak and strong, and has proven to Russia that the Brigade shall take what it wants! Let the weak tremble and the strong break before the might of our horde! It's time to make the Southern Urals our stomping ground!"
 ORS_our_backs_to_the_wall:0 "Our Backs to the Wall"
 ORS_our_backs_to_the_wall_desc:0 "The Ural League has been sending out hunting parties for months, and while we have managed to evade or destroy them time and time again, they have finally managed to track us down in full force. Pinned between the madmen to the east, the League and the Communes to our north and west, and the steppes to our south, it finally seems like it's time to make our stand. Little do those shitheads know that we have them right where we want them! We'll take out the goody two-shoed fucks and reap the spoils of Orenburg! We only need to prepare..."
 ORS_ready_the_boys:0 "Ready the Boys"
 ORS_ready_the_boys_desc:0 "Ready to rumble, ready to tumble, the boys of the Brigade are the nastiest, meanest bunch this side of Siberia. Pump a bandit full of vodka and maybe something a tad stronger and he'll kill anything standing between him and whatever, or whoever, he wants. It's time to spread around some booze and girls, and get the men pumped up for our next run!"
 ORS_we_ride_or_die:0 "We Ride or Die"
 ORS_we_ride_or_die_desc:0 "Ride or die! If the Brigade ain't pillaging then they ain't shit! We'll ride over any bastard thinking they're tough enough to play soldier and we'll show whoever they're keeping safe exactly what a bandit can do! Get ready boys, we ride for plunder!"
 ORS_keep_them_fresh:0 "Keep Them Fresh"
 ORS_keep_them_fresh_desc:0 "Can't let the lads get too soft! The boss knows as well as anyone that a lazy bandit's a dead bandit, lest we all remember what happened to old Christman and that little shit with the rusty pitchfork. Make sure the beds are hard and the weather chill, and as long as he's warmed up on vodka, a bandit will be content and sharp."
 ORS_keep_them_happy:0 "Keep Them Happy"
 ORS_keep_them_happy_desc:0 "The king knows how to treat his court! Vodka, women, drugs and song! Goods from abroad and goods ripped out of the frozen hands of whichever poor fuck we happened to find that day, stolen board games from looted schools and books from pillaged libraries, for the ones who know how to read at least. If a bandit can party, who the fuck cares how he really feels? Let 'em cheer up before they slaughter."

 ORS_prepare_new_raids_desc:0 "A lot of people think we're simple here in the band, that we're brutes who don't know how to plan, just a bunch of criminals and thugs who will beat and steal whatever they want. Well, they ain't wrong, but they don't realize that every raid's gotta be carefully planned. One's gotta know how to maximize casualties, maximize loot, and minimize the enemies' bravery, and Dirlewanger's been doin' that since before he ever even came to Russia. It's time to start digging deep into this, and plan for the big one!"
 ORS_gather_our_loot:0 "Gather our Loot"
 ORS_gather_our_loot_desc:0 "We gotta keep stock of what we got, unless we want some cocky fuckhead stealing vodka from the stores again. Not to mention, if we want to spread out the good times, we gotta know how many good times we got left! Keeping inventory is real important, but it's also boring, so we'll just have one of the Kazakhs do it."
 ORS_prepare_for_the_spoils:0 "Prepare for the Spoils"
 ORS_prepare_for_the_spoils_desc:0 "Gotta make room! It's time to clear out some old inventory, before all those good times expire! We've already thought up how much loot we're gonna be looking at in the next raid, let's make sure we got a place to put it all this time, unless we want a repeat of the time we had to finish off six crates of booze to stash those guns we found by Serov."

 ORS_the_black_bandit_on_the_black_mountain_desc:0 "The mad pedophile on top of his creepy mountain might actually make a good ally, and seems to be no friend of the losers over on their own mountains in the League. We don't know what the bastard wants but we sure have heard the rumors that he's got guns, guns, GUNS baby! And boy do we want some. Maybe we can crack out a deal, and then we can see about seeing what else he has later..."
 ORS_lysenkos_instruction:0 "Lysenko's Instruction"
 ORS_lysenkos_instruction_desc:0 "Oh what a day, what a lovely day! Not only did that freak on the rock have guns a'plenty, he had some old Soviet farts who know a thing or two about how to use them! Let's see what these guys got in the 'noggin, and see if the boys can actually learn something at the end of the day. Can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you can beat it until it knows where not to play!"
 ORS_organize_the_russians:0 "Organize the Russians"
 ORS_organize_the_russians_desc:0 "Dirlewanger's a weak nobody and all of us know it, so it won't be too hard to convince the Russians, who make up most of his group, to off the bastard. Some money spread around, some booze passed, and they'll be on our side!"
 ORS_expert_instruction:0 "Expert Instruction"
 ORS_expert_instruction_desc:0 "Sure, the Reds lost to us a while ago but we can't deny that they did at least try to put up a fight. Their instruction methods were rather brutal if memory serves; exactly what we need to get our boys in tip-top shape for the upcoming hunts."
 ORS_soviet_stratagem:0 "Soviet Stratagems"
 ORS_soviet_stratagem_desc:0 "Even though the Commies got their asses beat five ways to Friday not long ago, it turns out they still had a trick or two they never got to use. Most of it ain't possible for us, but with a bit of tinkering we can use some of this to great effect on our next run."
 ORS_soviet_arms:0 "Soviet Arms"
 ORS_soviet_arms_desc:0 "Old guns might be old but guns are guns! Who doesn't fucking love guns!? Let's pass these old clunkers out to the newer boys so Sokolov can stop having to use a fucking shovel to kill bitches."
 ORS_soviet_mastery:0 "Soviet Mastery"
 ORS_soviet_mastery_desc:0 "Between our home brew tactics and the stuff these old men rant about, we've gotten things down pat! A bit of flanking, a bit of rushing, it's nothing new to us, but we can use it all in such new and exciting ways! Who the fuck can wait to use 'em? We know we can't! So let's fucking do it!"
 ORS_lysenkos_promises:0 "Lysenko's Promises"
 ORS_lysenkos_promises_desc:0 "Lysenko asks for a lot, but he offers a lot too! Piles of cash, piles of booze... piles? Piles of women! Let's see what the old creep has to offer, and see what Black Mountain's really got inside!"

 ORS_the_think_tank:0 "The Think Tank"
 ORS_the_think_tank_desc:0 "Sure all of this stuff is pretty damn nice, but stuff is just stuff. Why don't we see if he'll give us some of his easily startled boffins too? They'd love to do some...field research, surely."
 ORS_loot_the_universe:0 "Loot the Universe"

 ORS_lysenkos_strategy:0 "Lysenko's Strategy"
 ORS_lysenkos_strategy_desc:0 "People, people, people. It's all Lysenko cares about! He doesn't want money, drugs or even women...in the conventional way at least. He is obsessed with more people for his experiments. He'll get his people, and we our blood and loot!"
 ORS_testing_our_enemies:0 "Testing Our Enemies"
 ORS_testing_our_enemies_desc:0 "The Ural League. Orenburg. Peasants. All sheep to the slaughter. Conquests to match the Romans await us, but we must first test our enemies strength before the real fun can begin."

 ORS_strike_at_the_urals_desc:0 "How does one describe the League without using the word 'pathetic'? Maybe we'll think of it as we put their people in their place."
 ORS_strike_at_orenburg:0 "Strike Orenburg"
 ORS_strike_at_orenburg_desc:0 "Orenburg is little more than a loose band of miserable 'communes' who have thus far suffered less raids from us than the League. It's time we changed that."
 ORS_strike_at_the_peasantry:0 "Strike at the Peasantry"
 ORS_strike_at_the_peasantry_desc:0 "Ah, the act of killing peasants, a sport as old as time itself. It is low risk for low reward, but it certainly is fun!"

 ORS_grab_the_healthy_fit_and_strong_desc:0 "We do not just raid for gold and blood, much more valuable is flesh. Every single person we take captive during our raids can in one way or another be pressed into service for us, they will kneel or they will die!"

 ORS_the_battle_of_novotroitsk_desc:0 "Our gambit worked! The Ural Guard have fallen into our trap, hastily erecting a defense of the town of Novotroitsk preparing to repel a small force. They will shit themselves when they see the truth of our deception."
 ORS_the_second_phase:0 "The Second Phase"
 ORS_the_second_phase_desc:0 "Now that the Ural Guard have been left in shock and momentarily crippled by the Battle of Novotroitsk, we shall take advantage of the holes in their lines to launch smaller raids on a number of their fortresses left exposed by the turmoil, whilst preparing still for our next great raid!"
 ORS_lessons_of_the_guard:0 "Lessons of the Guard"

 ORS.01.t:0 "The Dirlewanger Brigade: An Introduction"
 ORS.01.desc:0 "Formed out of the most heinous criminals of the Reich, the 36th Waffen-Grenadier Division of the SS - also known as the Dirlewanger Brigade, or, nowadays, as the Black Bandits- was originally designed as a counter-insurgency unit, but quickly became known for being one of the most cruel units within the Waffen-SS roster; so much so that even the SS were leery of associating themselves with them; the unit was not considered an official part of the Waffen-SS. Over time it became one of the most well-known and feared forlorn hope units within the German arsenal. Dirlewanger and his men were split from the Reich in the aftermath of the 1950s West Russia campaign; as the Germans retreated behind the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, Himmler began to lose trust in the Reich's ability to bring forth the Aryan future he envisioned, so he began ordering the SS units to prepare to turn against the Reich's soldiers; a mutiny attempt mostly foiled by a young Hans Speidel.\n\nHowever, one rogue unit managed to escape the Dirlewanger Brigade.\n\nHaving made their way to Orsk, the Brigade now mostly deals in banditry, its German equipment and its training giving it an advantage in the wastelands of Russia. Hated by everyone around them, the Brigade currently has three goals in mind: raid their neighbors, pillage Orenburg and assert supremacy in the area. And considering the chaotic character of Russia these days, they may as well succeed, unless any one of their neighbors manages to make the necessary preparations in time..."

 ORS.162.desc:0 "Initially, the meeting with those mountain-top creeps held a tone of optimism. Dirlewanger received an invitation written by Lysenko personally, scribbled in hasty German on brown-stained parchment. Of course Dirlewanger saw through this farce and opted to humor the mad scientist with his presence. At first the meeting seemed cordial by Uralic standards, a lone table amidst the tundra and mysterious meat smoking over a humble fire. Even Lysenko's men were pleasant with their offers of conversation and faux smiles. That all changed in a moment, however, when the Lysenko's rabid dogs released their anger upon the brigade. Amidst gunfire and chaos, Dirlewanger managed to dive into the cab of a Brigade truck and, under suppressing fire from fellow Brigademen, managed to escape unscathed. It was a relief to all the Brigade when he returned as the sole survivor of this horrible act of deceit. One thing is for sure, relations between those mad mountaineers and our Brigade have taken a turn for the far worse."

 ORS.200.desc:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger, leader of the infamous Dirlewanger Brigade, was killed by a partisan group yesterday. As he was on his way to a meeting with Lysenko, a small band of ex-NKVD partisans ambushed him and his men, killing Dirlewanger himself as well as several members of the Brigade.\n\nWhile the Brigade has exacted revenge on the village where this took place, without Dirlewanger at the helm, the Brigade has all but splintered. Various factions have already begun breaking off to terrorize the Urals, though it is likely they will find no quarter anywhere in Russia."

 ORS.201.d:0 "As Dirlewanger sits in his command tent, his eyes not just looking upon the map on the table, but to the future. The men are trained, they are equipped, they are ready and they are most certainly bloodthirsty. Deliberately, petty disagreements have been allowed to spin out of control to provoke even greater ferocity during our next raid. The only decision to make is where the raid will take place. There are three options Dirlewanger is considering:\n\nThe most entrancing would be to, as they say, go big or go home and launch a ferocious raid against the people of Orenburg. Due to their relative stability and the interference of the League, their lands thus far have suffered irritatingly few of our attacks. However, if we commit to one onslaught raid, we might be able to pillage some quality loot for ourselves and shatter their illusion of immunity to our attacks.\n\nThe most obvious choice would be to launch a raid against the League. We expect to enter full scale conflict with the League sooner than with Orenburg, and targeting their morale and numbers with a good raid would be quite valuable in the lead up to this greater conflict.\n\nFinally, Lysenko has informed us that if we so wish his forces will not interfere should we launch a raid against the peasantry within his territory. He likely believes the population we have promised him to be much larger than what we would take from him in this attack. As simple peasants, it would be unlikely they could put up much if any resistance to our attack, but do they have anything worth stealing?"

At the announcement, our men cheered and thrust their weapon in the air, eyes filled with lust for the loot awaiting them. The target settled upon is a town just past the border, which will hopefully act as a good judge of the quality of defense their 'Communes' have. Our commanders have been set to work on a plan of attack, and are confident that whilst we might encounter strong resistance within an individual commune, they will receive little if any reinforcements from other communes in the pathetic excuse for a state.

Then, from each of the four corners approached one of our Cossack officers dressed up as each of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, carrying dull lanterns within the mist. They lingered just within sight of the militia forces, distracting them whilst a shock force of our gulag recruits crawled under the mist, leaping up and inflicting quick and heavy losses upon the militia forces from close range. As the alarm was raised, our four horsemen led in separate Cossack charges, tearing through the streets cutting down everyone they encountered. Finally, our main force moved in, slaughtering any remaining defenders and storming every building within the commune. As our forces looted everything not nailed down, and a couple of things that were, the commune was set ablaze. Terrified, the surviving peasantry barricaded themselves within the town hall in some foolish notion they might escape unharmed. As our men prepared to burn the town hall too, Dirlewanger himself appeared through the mist covered in blood and instructed instead the peasants be ordered to surrender with the promise our forces would not harm them. Eagerly accepting, we have taken the survivors prisoner, and will be sending them off to Black Mountain. We have taken less than ideal casualties, having faced a tougher militia than expected, but this is a great victory."

The plan looked well constructed, our forces were well equipped and we committed generous numbers to the attack. We simply failed to account for one possibility: That the communes actually gave a damn about each other. Seemingly expecting our attack, our target commune had unknown to us received significant reinforcements and equipment from Orenburg and other communes in the area. As a shock unit of gulag recruits approached under the cover of a heavy mist, they were rapidly opened fire on by machine gun nests as soon as they revealed themselves to strike at the militia. The immediate losses were heavy and our gulag scum were routed. Consumed by a fit of rage, one of our field commanders ordered in the main body of our raiding force. By the time we finally overran the outer defenses of the commune, we had taken significant losses. As the fight moved to the streets and buildings, heavy resistance separated and pinned down groups of our men across the commune. Having shot the field commander who had ordered in the main assault force, Dirlewanger ordered the Cossacks to storm the streets and carve a path for our trapped forces to fall back and abandon the raid."

 ORS.205.d:0 "Thrusting his knife into the map, Dirlewanger has decided that we shall raid the Ural League! At the announcement, our men cheered and thrust their weapon in the air, eyes filled with hate for long standing enemy they would soon face. Many of our band of misfits have lost friends during the numerous raids into League territory, leading to a great thirst for retaliatory strikes such as this. Scouting the area, we have decided to launch the raid against an occupied gulag used for training new members of the Ural Guard. By slaughtering their pups, we can inflict despair in their regular members and fear in any fools who were considering joining. Moreover, targeting these new bloods will be valuable combat experience for many of our own newer members, as well as allowing us to test out techniques for assaulting the League's gulag bases."

 ORS.206.t:0 "Strike at the Ural League - The raid succeeds!"
 ORS.206.d:0 "There is always something deliciously ironic about attacking a gulag, a place so dedicated to keeping people in rather than keeping them out. In the dead of night, Waffen-SS infiltration specialists were able to sneak through the sewer systems below the facility and eventually seize control of the exit ways, allowing us to send a force of our raiders underneath and into the gulag. As our infiltrators next took control of the main gate, simultaneous attacks were launched both from within and without against the night shift and the sleep dazed, quickly scrambling for their equipment. Our pincer attack was able to overwhelm many of the initial defensive positions, allowing us to crack the fortress like an egg. Yet the Guard knew their base far better than we did, and apparently having been ordered to fall back many later positions were disappointingly found abandoned. Whilst we inflicted less casualties upon the Guard whelps than we hoped, their losses are still significant and we have seized the training facilities armory. Determined to send a message to anyone considering joining the Ural Guard, Dirlewanger ordered both the dead and captured recruits to be flayed and hung upside down from the gulag walls before we finally left with our spoils and bloodlust sated...for now."

The raid started well, Waffen-SS infiltration specialists taking control of the sewer system beneath the gulag, allowing us to attack from within and without. Yet we were unable to take control of the radio room in time, with Ural command ordering their forces to hold the gulag at all costs. What came next was a multi-hour bloodbath across the gulag, room by room, as the inexperienced Guard recruits held successive defensive lines with remarkable passion, repulsing a number of attacks between each fall back. Our slow progress left us unable to take control of the armory before it could be demolished by the enemy, preferring to lose the equipment rather than let us take it. Technically we did win, as after hours of conflict we finally broke the last elements of resistance, but this was no victory. Many of our men are dead or injured, including a number of our elite SS infiltrators, and we were unable to seize anything meaningful from the ruins. If anything, the Guard have been inspired by the bravery and sacrifice their brothers showed in the gulag's defense, with our scouts reporting numerous fresh recruits rallying to the Guard eager to fight us as news of the raid spread."

At the announcement, our men were oddly quiet and honestly looked quite disheartened they were going to be unleashed upon such a weak target. No-one would dare say it to his face, but it is clear some among us are wondering at the moment if Dirlewanger has turned craven. Set to task, our commanders have picked out a suitable raiding target village within Lysenko's territory. He has already informed us he does not intend to intervene with any of his men when we strike, so we will only need to worry about whatever meager defense the village can put up when we arrive."

We have pillaged the village for all it was worth, which is not very much, and put it to the torch. As a sign of gratitude we have arranged for the captured women to be sent to Black Mountain, whilst we will keep the children for ourselves."

We sent in some of the most brutal bastards the world has ever seen against simple peasants in one of the most unremarkable villages in Russia and yet somehow we were beaten back. Our commanders for once are not even bickering about whose fault this was, all in a shock of bafflement about how this happened at all. The only thing we are certain of is that for simple peasants the village was oddly well armed, and certain villagers oddly well trained in uncommon weaponry. This has caused speculation that Lysenko might have violated our agreement and in fact sent aid to the village in some sort of power play against us. With our defeat however we have no evidence of this, and Dirlewanger is unwilling to press his suspicions whilst the Ural League and Orenburg still exist. For now, we must just lick our wounds, and prepare for next time."

Our scouts have reported that the Ural Guard have built up a substantial base of operations within the industrial town of Novotroitsk.\n\nThe town is significant to the League due to the heavy mining industry it is based around, producing Khalilovsk ore, precious due it its rare composition of chromium, nickel, titanium and manganese.\n\nThere is little doubt in Dirlewanger's mind that this town is a cornerstone of the Ural League's war effort, and thus it is a prize we must take for ourselves! The value of the site is not lost on the League however, with a substantial Ural Guard garrison occupying the town. This will be a bloody battle, but is there any better kind?"

The history books will recall that the Battle of Novotroisk officially began at exactly 06:00 today with an artillery bombardment upon the Ural Guard's outer positions around the town. Knowing the value of his prize, Dirlewanger authorised a blank cheque to his commanders for the use of equipment.\n\nThe bombardments came in waves, shelling for twenty minutes, then five minutes of rest for the enemy to scurry out of their holes, only to begin another twenty minutes of shelling. After three hours, the bombardment stopped and our bloodthirsty bastards were sent in.\n\nThe dazed defenders were incapable of putting up much of a resistance, and their outer positions were quickly taken. Next came the push into the suburbs where more effective resistance was met, meeting machine gun fire from the buildings. Pinned down behind low walls and fences Dirlewanger, in the field himself, ordered that smoke grenades be deployed before sending in flamethrower troops to burn out the machine gun nests. The air was filled with smoke and blood, and it was beautiful.\n\nAfter several hours of fighting, we have secured the outskirts of Novotroisk and set up a fresh command post inside of an old school. Next, we must push in to take the Industrial District before the Guard can destroy it."

Industry is not the easiest thing to come by in these brutal lands, thanks in no small part to our Luftwaffe 'friends'. Novotroitsk appears to have been spared the worst of the damage, but our commanders are painfully aware the Guard would sooner destroy their factories and equipment than let us take it. As soon as we took the outskirts of the town, we immediately made a push to attempt to carry our momentum into seizing the industry quickly.\n\nYet it was not to be, our men forced to fight into the night. The next morning, enraged by the destruction the League inflicted to the district through the night, Dirlewanger ordered an all out assault on Guard positions. Following another full day of fighting, during which the League detonated the explosives within a series of factories whilst our men were inside inflicting heavy losses, we finally have secured the district.\n\nThe damage is extensive, with at least one third of the factories beyond repair and many more damaged. Still, with the resources we seized, this is a victory. Now we must take the town center, crushing the last of the enemy resistance and securing the town for ourselves."

Make no mistake however, the Guard will make their last stand here to protect these people.\n\nOur push into the town center quickly delivered on the promised bloodbath, with brutal street fighting and room to room combat. Each street taken was a costly victory, our progress hampered by the enemies unexpected use of anti-tank weapon placements against our advance. In each firefight, the only cover has been piles of rubble, overturned tables or old wooden piano's. In some areas, fighting devolved to the use of bricks and bottles when ammunition ran dry for both sides.\n\nFinally, after two more days of fighting, our trucks unloaded troops outside of the Ural command post within the town hall and stormed the building under heavy fire. Our forces outside waited with baited breath before finally one valiant SS officer appeared on the balcony with a bucket of blood and painted the symbol of the Brigade upon the building, sparking cheers from below!"
 ORS.214.a:0 "Victory is ours!"
 ORS.215.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - Victory"
 ORS.215.d:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk is over, and the town is ours. With the last of the Ural Guard's positions overrun, their pathetic fighters either surrendered or chose to die fighting. The next few hours were utter carnage as our men were set loose on the town now free of the enemy. Quickly, any of the civilian population who participated in the fight against us were rounded up and promptly shot, along with all of the adult men for good measure. The only ones spared were those who worked in the mines or factories, who we shall swiftly put to work.\n\nGiven free reign of the town center, the town's women folk have endured horrendous treatment whilst everything of value was looted from around them. The victory was culminated by a massive bonfire of the enemy corpses outside of the town hall, whilst Dirlewanger gave a speech from the town hall balcony congratulating our jubilant men on this great victory. Control of this town will surely be a boon to morale, but more importantly, our war machine too."

 ORS.216.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - Defeat"
 ORS.216.d:0 "The situation in the field has developed, and not necessarily to our advantage. Our men have fought like lions, taking control of a good half of Novotroitsk. However the Ural Guard resistance is strong, and our lines are beginning to crumble. It devolved into an inability to launch further assaults, before devolving further into an inability to hold our captured territory in the town.\n\nWe most certainly did not make it easy for them, the streets filled with their dead, but we have been beaten back and finally forced to withdraw. This is not a total defeat, the destruction we inflicted upon the town sure to hamper their war machine for some time, but it is not the victory we wanted, or deserved."
 ORS.216.a:0 "The streets run red for us both."
 ORS.217.t:0 "The Second Phase"
 ORS.217.d:0 "This is a day we have been dreaming about for a very long time. The Ural Guard, our prime nemesis ever since we arrived in this horrid land, has been left crippled and disorganized across the line as a result of our deception at Novotroitsk. As a result, a number of areas across the border lands lay wide open for us to pillage, and pillage we shall!\n\nDirlewanger is particularly interested in securing any and all equipment that might aid us when we inevitably turn on that madman Lysenko. By looting their gulag fortresses and mountain fortifications, we will secure all of the equipment needed to more than match Lysenko's technological superiority. His fancy toys will do nothing to save him if our bullets and artillery block out the sun above.\n\nEven if the siege does turn out to be a lengthy affair, raiding the various farms now left vulnerable across the Urals will fill our larders for quite some time. Should we face even a single defeat against Lysenko, our officers will have only themselves to blame, and Dirlewanger will ensure that they know that."
 ORS.217.a:0 "Take it all!"
 ORS.218.t:0 "A Second Great Raid"
 ORS.218.d:0 "The boys are getting bored, and bored boys are troublesome boys. Not in the good way either. Our forces are getting so seasoned that simple raids are just part of the day for them now, carried out just as easily as using the latrine. This simply will not do, and so we shall have another great raid! Just as during our last great raid, three options lay before us:\n\nOrenburg is the great prize of the Urals, the mythical city of plunder. Our boys dream of it in their sleep, then fantasize of it during the day. They would jump at the chance to go back into those lands and cause as much trouble as they could.\n\nThe second option would be to launch our greatest raid yet against those Ural League bastards. No other group in the Urals brings forth such a thirst for revenge from our boys, all of whom have lost a friend or three at the hands of the Guard. Allowing them to take out their tensions with some savage blows would be good for morale, but by no means an easy feat.\n\nIf we want difficult however, there is option three. Our ballsiest commanders have put forward the plan to launch great raids against Orenburg and the Ural League both. It would be hard, very hard, but the fame and loot we could take would be unprecedented! Weakening both of our enemies would just be an added bonus."
 ORS.218.a:0 "Excited? No, I'm just happy to see you."
 ORS.219.t:0 "Draw out the Guard"
 ORS.219.d:0 "These Ural Guard, the 'heroes' that these people love to celebrate, are gaining a reputation far too big for their britches. Each time we raid into their territory, the Guard are only too happy to stand against us time and time again. But it is time to bring them down a peg, and bring them down hard.\n\nWe will launch a series of raids across their border to draw their cowardly garrisons out from their gulag fortresses and into more...exposed ground. We will pick the time and place for their destruction, and they will not know we have done so until it is far too late. Our boys will drench the soil in their 'heroic' blood!"
 ORS.219.a:0 "Heroism has no place in these lands."
 ORS.220.t:0 "Demand Double - Lysenko sends half."
 ORS.220.d:0 "Our favorite freak Lysenko has responded to our demands for double payment for the latest batch of captives, and has refused. Apparently he will not tolerate our attempts to bully him into submission, and has warned any further attempts at the kind of behavior may mean the end of our relationship.\n\nWe have not been left empty handed however, as Lysenko has send half of the original amount rather than the double we requested. It seems he was not willing to cut us off entirely over this matter, and he still has use to us, but we are less than pleased with the outcome."
 ORS.220.a:0 "We gambled, and we lost."
 ORS.250.t:0 "Transfer the Flesh"
 ORS.250.d:0 "We made a deal with Lysenko, and to give credit where credit is due it was a remarkably simple deal. In our raids and conquests we take as many prisoners as possible, and we hand them over for his experimentations. In return, we get our fair share of the technological wonders of Black Mountain. Whilst our boys can hardly be called honest, most are happy with the current deal.\n\nYet there are those amongst us who are complaining, perhaps rightly, that we are doing all of the leg work here whilst Lysenko sits up there doing whatever weird things it is he does to pass the time. We deserve a bigger piece of the pie they say, but is it worth risking a good thing?"
 ORS.250.a:0 "Decisions, decisions."
 ORS.251.t:0 "Hand Them Over."
 ORS.251.d:0 "Lysenko is, undeniably, a pretty weird guy. He rarely seems to leave his laboratories, more of a cowering creature than a man. He never deals with anyone from our side other than Dirlewanger himself, alway sending one of his equally weird 'assistants' to oversee the transactions between us. Today, as our slavemaster arrived at Black Mountain with our latest haul of captives, it was business as usual.\n\nWith the decision made to not antagonize Black Mountain unnecessarily, our man observed as a group of scientists spending an unnerving amount of time inspecting the captives. Seemingly satisfied, the captives were led away and we were directed to Lysenko's security forces to sort out the proper transfer of equipment in return.\n\nApparently the list had been pre-approved by Lysenko the previous night, leaving no room for us to request anything different. Regardless, it is all quality stuff which we will easily be able to put to good use."
 ORS.251.a:0 "There must be honor amongst thieves."
 ORS.252.t:0 "The Deal Changed - Lysenko agrees."
 ORS.252.d:0 "Our man at Black Mountain has sent back word that Lysenko has surrendered to our demands for an increased payment for the captives we are delivering. We get the impression he is by no means pleased by our sudden change of heart, but we don't really care if he likes it or not. All that matters is that the madman caved like the cowardly creature he is, and extra supplies will reach our boys from now on."
 ORS.252.a:0 "Slavery is a lucrative business."

He never deals with anyone from our side other than Dirlewanger himself, alway sending one of his equally weird 'assistants' to oversee the transactions between us. Today, as our slavemaster arrived at Black Mountain with our latest haul of captives, it was business as usual.\n\nThat was the case at least until one of the scientists remarked how impressed they were with the number of 'specimens' we were providing, to which our man replied it was easy when we have as many men as we do, ready to fight anywhere, and anyone, at a moments notice.\n\nWorried by the possible implication, Lysenko's lackeys tried to wrap the deal up quickly. But with Dirlewanger's authorization, our man informed them the deal had changed. We have been taking the risks, so we want more than the previously negotiated amount. The 'or else' was not said, but clearly implied.\n\nLyseko's assistant has retreated, claiming the demand can only be accepted or denied by the mad scientist himself."
 ORS.253.a:0 "Brains versus brawn, it seems."
 ORS.254.t:0 "The Deal Changed - Lysenko stands firm."
 ORS.254.d:0 "Having sent our slavemaster to Black Mountain, we expected that he would come back victorious with extra spoils now we have decided to confront Lysenko on the matter of the value of our prisoners. What we did not expect, however, was that Lysenko would actually have a spine when threatened.\n\nToday we received the charred bodies of our slavemasters bodyguards, the slavemaster himself having vanished from the face of the earth as far as we can tell. Accompanying the bodies was a written note from Lysenko claiming that the group had attempted to change the regular deal when they arrived, which Lysenko was 'certain was against their orders, going by our previous agreements' and was a simple 'matter of thuggish extortion'.\n\nAs punishment Lysenko 'exterminated' them, and has informed us due to our 'inability to install discipline in our dignitaries' that we will be receiving no payment for this batch of captives at all, which we will not be getting back either."
 ORS.254.a:0 "You win this round, freak."
 ORS.255.t:0 "Demand Double - Lysenko sends double."
 ORS.255.d:0 "Our favorite freak Lysenko has caved to our demands for double the payment for the latest batch of captives, the supplies finally reaching us today. Apparently whilst displeased at our extortion attempt, he is of the opinion that the better supplied we are the more of our joint enemies we will be able to kill. He has no idea we will indeed use this equipment to kill our enemies, Lysenko himself among them."

 ORS.256.d:0 "The fire of our hearts is consuming the lands of the Ural League, burning hotter and brighter with each passing day. Now their people are refugees, fleeing as fast as their little feet can carry them from our advance. During the days our scouts stalk their columns of broken vermin, trudging forth with sorrow in their eyes and defeat in their hearts. At night, when they seek some small respite in sleep, our men descend to awaken them to a nightmare. We kill their men with savagery, relieve our frustrations with their women, and take their children to serve us. Any supplies they have are taken before we finally just burn it all to the ground. At night our men no longer navigate by the stars, but by the fires across the land."

 ORS.257.d:0 "It was a fools notion, that all those pathetic communes would ever be able to mount any kind of defense against us. They were living in a fantasy, but we have forced them to realize the truth of their utopia. They thought the Ural Guard would protect them, it was as a lie. They thought their leaders would protect them, it was a lie. They thought, at the very least, they could protect each other...but it was a lie. The landscape is filled with the ashen husks of these communes, littered with the dead and pillaged of all valuables. So often we find that their people have chosen to die by their own hand rather than ours when we arrive, and we relish in it for they have finally seen our truth. The fantasy is over, their utopia has fallen."

 ORS.258.t:0 "Salt the earth!"
 ORS.258.d:0 "Ever since there were armies, their commanders have usually realised that an army only marches on its stomach. They may want for much more, but they need their food. We have come across crop fields aplenty in Orenburg's lands, enough to feed our army well. They certainly need it with all the effort they've been putting in to kill these miserable people. But just as our army marches on its stomach, so does theirs. And so we shall leave nothing for them!\n\nOur boys have set to work throwing salt into the earth after we have taken the crops, as well as filling them with landmines. Wells have been poisoned, often by dropping dead cattle inside. Irrigation and waterways have been destroyed. Pipes have been ripped up from the ground, wires ripped from the walls. We have taken the spoils of this land, and now no-one will ever be able to use it again."
 ORS.258.a:0 "We are the end times."
 ORS.259.t:0 "Let all know fear..."
 ORS.259.d:0 "We have come to a most delicious realization; we have inflicted such horror and terror on these people that we have begun to cross the line into myth. It all started with a scouts report that a grandmother had told her grandson that if he did not eat, Dirlewanger would come and snatch him away. We kept our ears open, and heard so much more.\n\nApparently our horses charge in with hooves of blazing fire. Dirlewanger has burning coals for eyes, rotten skin and the legs of a goat. Our men have superhuman strength and the genitalia of horses. Our weapons were blessed by the devil himself to inflict as much pain as possible. We take our prisoners and sacrifice them to Hitler, who has ascended to godhood following his death. We are so powerful because we have the ability to raise the dead after each battle to swell our corrupted ranks.\n\nThese are all highly entertaining, but more importantly, are proof that we will live on in history as utter villains, right where we wanted to be. Our names will last a thousand years!"
 ORS.259.a:0 "We could never be a page in someone else's history book!"
 ORS.260.t:0 "The Plot Begins..."
 ORS.260.d:0 "As terrifying as the SS truly are, they have one fatal weakness. Just like the rest of us, they are only human. With each year passed, with each battle fought, more and more of the original members of Dirlewanger's brigade have died, forcing them to accept more and more local recruits. Recruits who know all too well the brutality and horrors inflicted upon their country and themselves at the hands of the Germans. The time has come to extract our revenge, bring down Dirlewanger and kick these German scum out of our lands!"
 ORS.260.a:0 "Now is the time, and we will risk everything."
 ORS.261.t:0 "An Offer Is Made..."
 ORS.261.d:0 "A man can be pushed, and pushed, but he can only be pushed so far. Many of the Russians in the brigade came willingly to Dirlewanger's banner, seeking an escape from their poverty stricken lives badly enough they were willing to deal with the devil to do so. Already we have enacted terrible raids against Russian communities, done unspeakable things, to say nothing of Dirlewanger's actions during the war. But now we hear he has plans for unprecedented attacks against the Ural League and Orenburg, and the Russians have finally reached their breaking point.\n\nWe don't know how they learned, but they have come to us and informed us they wish to join our plot to murder Dirlewanger. The only condition of their loyalty is that we also kill every single German son of a bitch around..."
 ORS.261.a:0 "...and of course we accept!"
 ORS.262.t:0 "Approaching The Taken..."
 ORS.262.d:0 "Before the Brigade reached Orsk, we went through territory now calling itself 'Nowa Polska', a most curious place filled with ethnic Kazakhs and Poles aplenty. The result was a number of raids that pressed many refugees into our service almost always against their will. These people know just as well as the Russians the atrocities Dirlewanger and his Germans have enacted against innocent people.\n\nWhilst he was on patrol, our plotters met with the leader of the Polish-Kazakh faction within the Brigade and asked them to join us. The man agreed on the spot, and we spent the rest of the patrol through the woodland discussing what part they would play in the scheme. In return, besides the sheer pleasure of having Dirlewanger dead, we have promised that they will be allowed to return to Nowa Polska freely after the deed is done."
 ORS.262.a:0 "The past will come for Dirlewanger, and it will strike hard."
 ORS.263.t:0 "To The Highest Bidder..."
 ORS.263.d:0 "We have secured the support of the two largest non-German factions within the Brigade, but there is another group who might interfere with our plans if we do not bring them over to our side. A number of mercenary groups of all kinds have been brought into the service of Dirlewanger, drawn in by the promises of plentiful plunder, bloodshed and women. Yet these men were bought, they care nothing for Dirlewanger himself. We know, in fact, some actively dislike him. These people sell themselves to the highest bidder, and all we need to do is put in that higher bid.\n\nWe have held secret meetings with the most powerful of these mercenary leaders. As we suspected, they can be convinced to accept a better offer from us and abandon Dirlewanger, but it will not be cheap. After many nights of negotiations, we have come to two deals they would be willing to accept. Either we grant them significant manpower from our faction, to make up for the recruits they would take in Dirlewanger's conquests, or we promise them almost the entirety of Dirlewanger's plunder stores. It's a hard choice, but what will we agree to?"
 ORS.263.a:0 "Give them their men."

 ORS.264.t:0 "Their Last Meal..."
 ORS.264.d:0 "We have instilled chaos amongst the Germans within our ranks, exactly as we planned. With the Russians, Kazakhs, Poles and the mercenaries committed to our plot it was a simple matter. The Germans simply consider themselves above us, above the most basic and 'dirty' of tasks. As a result, it is from the ranks of our plotters that the food preparation staff are drawn. From there, it was a simple matter to poison the meals of as many Germans as possible one evening.\n\nBy the end of the night it had been announced that some kind of epidemic had been rapidly spreading through the camp with a large number of casualties, including the entirety of Dirlewanger's elite guards. There are a number of theories spreading about what had happened, with the two dominant theories being either the Ural Guard managed to tamper with our supplies or Lysenko had unleashed a new weapon upon us.\n\nBy the time the truth is fully understood, there will be almost no-one alive who cares it was us."

 ORS.265.d:0 "It had snowed heavily during the night, leaving a crisp morning as Dirlewanger had walked from the latrine back towards his tent. The first blade came as if from nowhere, cutting deep into his side. Then another blade came for him, and another, and then another. One by one they came, and by the time it was over Dirlewanger had been stabbed over two dozen times. Collapsing to the ground, mortally wounded, he could not speak. With the last of his strength all he could do was bring his fur lined cloak to cover his face, hiding his gaze from his betrayers.\n\nBy midday most of the band had left, packing up what supplies they could and heading off in all directions to either form their own bands or go on to their next adventure. All that remained were the empty tents waving in the wind, the embers of the fires and Dirlewanger's lifeless body, left openly in the snow."

We will let them go forth and do whatever it is they feel like doing, consequence free, for an entire week. The only requirements are that they report back to camp once the time has expired, they don't kill any of their officers, and they cause as much trouble as possible."

But among those who have returned, morale has never been higher.\n\nOur officers are reporting that we had been actually underestimating the cruelty our boys were capable of, and when given a week free of consequence let their true colors shine.\n\nVillages have been burned, cattle slaughtered, old men fed to dogs, crop fields destroyed, wells poisoned, countless lynched, riches looted, alcohol abused, and women tortured so badly no-one in the band can claim to be innocent of sodomy anymore. Those are only a small portion of what they managed to inflicted to boot.\n\nThey have brought back riches and slaves aplenty, along with shining smiles that warm Dirlewanger's old heart in these cold lands."

Rather than another regular skirmish, we shall mobilize a full scale raid!\n\nWe shall launch simultaneous strikes against three locations within League territory:\n\nAn old Soviet airstrip turned ammunition depot, an old sports stadium which has been converted into a refugee camp and finally an Ural Guard field command post.\n\nAlongside these strikes, two dozen smaller raids will be launched along the border to keep the Guard distracted from our main targets."

As the blood saturated the soil, we filled out trucks with as much as they could carry before detonating what remained of the ammunition depot, along with the fuel stocks, and destroyed the runway. We didn't find any planes there, but better to be safe than sorry.\n\nOver at the sports stadium, our boys struck in the night. Blocking the exits, they proceeded to throw petrol bombs into the refugee camp inside. The fires spread rapidly across the tents, screams engulfing the nights silence. Anyone lucky enough to manage to climb over the walls were promptly shot as a reward.\n\nFinally, part of our Waffen-SS unit specializing in stealth assaulted an Ural Guard command post. Dozens were killed in their beds, throats slit, along with the assassination of three senior officers.

We will let them go forth and do whatever it is they feel like doing, consequence free, for three days. The only requirements are that they report back to camp once the time has expired, they don't kill any of their officers, and they cause as much trouble as possible.\n\nThe other half of our forces will be sent across the border with the League and launch three simultaneous strikes against one of their ammunition depots in an old Soviet airfield, a refugee camp based out of an old sports stadium and an Ural Guard command post.\n\nNeither raid will have reinforcements, so it will be do or die.

 ORS.275.d:0 "It has been a couple of months since our last exchange with our favorite freak Lysenko. Now following our recent great raid we have fresh captives that he will no doubt be excited to get his hands on. Whilst there are still voices within the band who argue that we should be taking more and more reward with each captive handed over, Dirlewanger has chosen to ignore them. We have more immediate fights against the Ural League and Orenburg approaching, it is not worth antagonizing Black Mountain just yet. As per the deal, we have sent our captives over to the scientists and have received our equipment in return."

 ORS.276.d:0 "It has been a long time now since we gloriously served the Führer, but some ways of our former lives have still remained in place. One of these has been the Nazi salute, often accompanied with the phrase "Sieg Heil". Of course, ever since we were betrayed by our country, we have no Nazi Party; the gesture has instead migrated over as a mark of respect and loyalty to Dirlewanger, particularly among the Germans in our band.\n\nWith growing numbers of non-Germans in the Brigade, and the fact that we no longer serve the Reich, a number of our boys are questioning why we are still doing this gesture at all. Should we continue to promote its use or let it fall away?"

 ORS.276.b:0 "We are forging our own destiny without Germany, abandon the salute."
 ORS.277.t:0 "The Oldest Of Us Has Died"
 ORS.277.d:0 "We have few ties to our homeland, back when we were a mere SS Division. Aside from some uniforms, flags and general memorabilia the largest of these connections are the original German members of the Brigade who have always held a special place for Dirlewanger. Yet our oldest member, Karl Wilhelm Müller, has died at the age of 73. Suffering from ailing health for the last few years, he suffered a stroke in camp two days ago which proved to be the last that he could take, finally passing away this morning.\n\nThe loss is being felt hard by the other members of the 'old guard' in the band, but importantly is beginning to raise questions about what exactly will happen if old age becomes brave enough to come after Dirlewanger."
 ORS.277.a:0 "Rest in peace, old friend."
 ORS.278.t:0 "Tensions Within The Band"
 ORS.278.d:0 "Our band of merry maniacs is many things, but unified is far from one of them. Within our ranks are Germans, Austrians, Poles, Kazakhs, Russians, Ukrainians and among them criminals, political prisoners, sadists, rejects, concentration camp prisoners and lunatics. That is only a fraction of our composition these days to boot. As it turns out, all these different groups have difficulties getting along and a number of factions exist within the Brigade.\n\nWe have been aware of these tensions for some time due to the issues they have sometimes caused in the field with the following of orders, but this seems to have boiled over last night. After one too many drinks two of these factions came to blows, a massive brawl erupting in the middle of the camp as other groups got involved as well.\n\nCurious as to how it would play out, survival of the fittest and all, Dirlewanger allowed it to continue to its natural conclusion without his interference. By morning, eight were dead and twenty three more injured.\n\nThe surviving lead instigators have been executed for their roles in the brawl, and for now peace has returned. But this has once again raised the question of what exactly will happen one day when Dirlewanger dies and the unifying force of the band is gone."

 ORS.279.t:0 "Downed Luftwaffe Pilot Captured!"
 ORS.279.d:0 "Yesterday the band was thrown into disarray when a large snowstorm flared up seemingly out of nowhere, and moved straight through the camp. This morning we assessed the damage, with our equipment being the main thing affected along with scattered tents and minor injuries.\n\nYet with a clearer view of our surroundings, we have discovered something infinitely more interesting. Searching after some of the scattered equipment our boys discovered a downed Luftwaffe fighter along with its pilot, injured but alive. It would seem that the pilot had been on a terror bombing mission over Orsk when the snowstorm forced him to crash.\n\nInterrogating and torturing him thoroughly, we have learned a number of things about our former homeland. It seems Hitler is still Führer but Germany faces increasing unrest from within, and that there has been a great split between the Reich and the SS. Each word ripped open our old wounds, and the pilot has been hung from the nearest tree."
 ORS.279.a:0 "We'll make them all pay, one day..."
 ORS.280.t:0 "Fire in Orsk!"
 ORS.280.d:0 "Whilst our band moves around a lot to raid, our main base remains in the captured city of Orsk which we return to as needed. However we care far more about loot, slaves and bloodshed than we do about actually running some miserable city and so it largely lacks any form of administration.\n\nIt turns out this is not always to our benefit however, and the lack of oversight as well as the general piss-poor state of Orsk's infrastructure has resulted in a fire. We are not sure how it started, but a number of buildings and lives have been lost to the blaze.\n\nThankfully the majority of our spoils and slaves have been left intact, but the fires did ravage a section of the factory district, impacting what little industry we have."
 ORS.280.a:0 "We'll just have to do some more looting then!"
 ORS.281.t:0 "Cholera Outbreak!"
 ORS.281.d:0 "Life in the Urals is one of extremes for our merry band. We drink alcohol excessively, yet finding clean water is a rarity outside of winter. We feast on the spoils of our raids, yet face rotten and poorly cooked meals in leaner times. Often on the move, our sanitation situation is a complete monstrosity. Combined with how often we deal with the dead, the risk of disease is significant.\n\nUnfortunately one such situation has developed, with one of our few doctors reporting Cholera has broken out in camp. Over sixty men are infected, many seriously with twelve casualties so far. Among our prisoners and slaves scores are infected due to their particularly bad living conditions.\n\nWith the scarcity of medical supplies out here, the numbers are expected to rise and get worse before it gets better. There is little we can do but wait out the outbreak, bury our dead and move on."
 ORS.281.a:0 "Our boys deserved to die raiding, not like this."
 ORS.282.t:0 "The Most Dangerous Game"
 ORS.282.d:0 "Morale has been going steady lately, but it can always been improved and so Dirlewanger has arranged for a contest to be held within the Brigade. All members are welcome to participate, but all who wish to partake are required to pay an entry fee of a certain percentage of their spoil stashes. The winner will then take all of the spoils put into the pot, along with receiving a gift from Dirlewanger himself.\n\nThe game is simple: At dawn a number of our slaves and prisoners will be set free and unknown to them given a three hour head start. Then the contestants are set loose and the aim of the game is to return after twelve hours with as many heads as possible, the man with the most heads wins.\n\nThe competition has been a great success, even if more heads did come back than we actually sent out."

 ORS.283.d:0 "'String him up!'\n\n'Kill the bastard!'\n\n'Cut off his cock and shove it down his throat!'\n\nThese were the cries echoing through the camp as the beaten and bloodied form of our 'guest' was dragged through the mud to the center of camp. We discovered him scurrying through our supplies like the rat that he is, and following a thorough session of torture it was discovered that the man is in fact a spy for the Ural League.\n\nIt's almost a compliment that they find the notion of fighting us daunting enough they want to gage our strength and supplies with subterfuge. We do like it when people pay us the proper respect after all, but this is a step too far.\n\nBrought before all to see, the spy was tied to a pyre and set alight, his screams matched only by the howls of the wolves. We'll dump the body at the border and let it serve as a message.\n\nIf they want to judge our strength, they can do it whilst we're killing them."

 ORS.284.d:0 "Today has been a bountiful day indeed. Whilst scouting out the lands of Orsk for any targets we might raid between larger raids on our enemies, we have discovered an operational hospital which had managed to escape our notice.\n\nUntil today, that is.\n\nHearing the report, Dirlewanger immediately ordered the raid and our boys descended. We faced only minor resistance from a civilian force, which we overwhelmed with ease, then went after the spoils. In a part of the world where medicine is difficult to come by, the medical supplies we have captured are worth their weight in gold and then some. Combined with the beautiful nurses we found and the few doctors we have pressed into service this had been a great day for the band. Any patients we found in the hospital have been executed and the building itself set ablaze."
 ORS.284.a:0 "They will serve us, or they will die."
 ORS.285.t:0 "An Excellent Hunting Scene"
 ORS.285.d:0 "There is only so much that can be raided, and as our band has grown so too has our demand for the most basic of goods. The need for meat but more importantly furs to protect us against the bitter winters here led to the formation of hunters within our ranks, responsible for doing just that whilst the rest of us raid, recover and raid some more.\n\nListening to the reports, it appears that we have had a particularly good hunting season this year. A large number of wolf, bear and elk furs have been secured for our stores and will be distributed among those most deserving of Dirlewanger's favor within the band.\n\nA little competition never hurt anybody, and the rewards make themselves clear in times like these."

 ORS.286.d:0 "Prepare as we have, the Russian winters are perhaps our match in terms of their cruelty. So often even the strongest and bravest of men can do nothing against the bitter cold and harsh landscape.\n\nWhilst we Germans are undoubtedly superior to these Russians, we are not invulnerable nor immune to these temperatures. So far the cold has claimed the lives of twenty-seven of our men, usually slipping away from us during the night.\n\nIt is sobering to face our vulnerability and insignificance against these bitter feats of nature, yet we know that once we are through it it will be proof yet again of why we are the toughest, meanest sons of bitches these lands have ever seen!"

 ORS.287.d:0 "As winter continues we have come across a most fascinating sight. Buried within the snow and ice we have discovered a small detachment of T-26 tanks and the frozen skeletal remains of a number of Soviet soldiers. We suspect they must have been on their way to the front during the German invasion of the Soviet Union all those years ago, only to be claimed by the freezing temperatures before they could arrive.\n\nIt is a beautiful though haunting sight, a reminder of who we once were and how far we have come since. The equipment is beyond repair and so we must leave it, but the reminder that men are not the only enemy we face out here will stick in our minds for some time."

This sounds like a great thing, something to celebrate as we pillage whatever pathetic holdings the League held across the mountains, but there is no celebration in Dirlewanger's camps.\n\nAs what meager loot was found is piled at the feet of the Bandit King, he seethes. His men have already begun chasing what few survivors remain, but the road to the Ural's riches remain closed for him. His men were too slow, and Lysenko has already taken most of the mountain for himself, ignoring Dirlewanger's demands for his rightful pillage.\n\nEvery gun piled in front of him, every small piece of jewelry and scant scrap of loot only drives his anger further. How dare that bitch of a scientist shun him like this? How dare him!? HOW DARE HE!?\n\nThere will be righteous revenge in time. For now, Dirlewanger looks to Orenburg. After that, who can say?"

 ORS.300.d:0 "This has been a long journey, longer and bloodier than any of our band ever expected all those years ago. When we were simply the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' of the SS, no-one would have guessed twenty years later we would have endured what we have endured, done what we have done. The best part? We know in our hearts that no-one, no-one, else could have done this but us. All of our efforts have led us here, to this moment, to this great conquest.\n\nThe madman Lysenko was once our ally, and a valuable one at that. But he has finally reached the end of his usefulness to us now that the Ural League is destroyed and Orenburg thoroughly pillaged. Black Mountain is home to technological and scientific marvels that baffle the mind, that belong in novels rather than reality. We have enjoyed these fruits over time, but why just have the occasional fruit when you can own the whole damn tree? Black Mountain will be the true jewel in our crown, and once it is ours we will be truly unstoppable."

 ORS.301.d:0 "It was long, and it was hard, but we have done it. The last defenders have crumbled, and Black Mountain is ours at long last. For the first time in our conquests our men were sent against a professional military force, Lysenko's 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD. Whilst not the force it once was, when combined with the fences, tall walls, minefields and gun nests defending the mountain base, it was not an easy fight. Yet as soon as we pushed into the laboratories, how quickly our boys longed to fight soldiers again.\n\nWe had no idea of the extent of Lysenko's experiments, and our people encountered trap after trap as we attempted to secure the interior. Electric traps which boiled their blood, concussive waves which blew out their eyeballs, poison gas melting their lungs, legions of crazed experiments charging with filthy knives and brute force. The survivors will never forget the horrors of those laboratories, but finally we secured Black Mountain for ourselves. We have captured numerous fascinating pieces of equipment and revolutionary research, along with many of Lysenko's scientists working on the Mountain.\n\nYet captured soldiers are telling us Lysenko became obsessed with not allowing his work to fall into 'uneducated barbaric' hands, and so detonated explosives in many of his deeper labs holding his most prized experiments. Whether he was able to flee or burned with his work is unknown, but no trace has been found alive or dead."

But just because there isn't the people, doesn't mean there is not plenty of loot they left behind!\n\nThe conquests of the Ural League, Orenburg and now Magnitogorsk have taken their toll on our boys, but we shall give them free reign to loot, burn and kill all they wish within these lands.\n\nWith the Urals now ours, let the world know no-one can stand against us!"

 ORS.305.d:0 "One of the men who accompanied our latest raid has found himself before Dirlewanger himself today, as a disagreement between he and his commanding officer has gained notoriety within the camp. The soldier has made the audacious claim that he is not being provided with enough for all that he does for the raids, and that those who plunder the most should henceforth receive the most. He continues on to claim that the officer refuses to provide the men their fair share, and brazenly states that the officer's own contributions pale in comparison to his, something not represented in the rewards.\n\nNot willing to let his arguments be dismissed, the soldier produces a small sack of 'evidence'. The bag of evidence produced a foul smell that, upon opening, was revealed to be quite a brutal bounty. Inside laid at least a dozen pairs of strung together ears, ones that the soldier claimed to have removed from his victims during the raiding. The soldier continued to rant about how this was proof enough that he deserved far more loot than he was given, and that he demanded rewards to match his far superior contributions to the cause. All eyes were on Dirlewanger to set the precedent for the future."

 ORS.306.d:0 "Dirlewanger took time out of his extremely busy schedule today to utterly lay into the so called idiot officer that started the argument over the proper allotment of loot for soldiers. More than a few in the camp believed this to be the final moments of the officer, as Dirlewanger went on a tirade against him. The officer was insulted in various ways, ranging from being a 'fucking moron' to being 'up for castration and demotion into a human shield'. The smack and storm flowing out of Dirlewanger's mouth was truly a sight to behold for those that were present, as the verbal annihilation of the man went on for a considerable length of time. Dirlewanger was, to say the least, displeased that the officer caused a stir that could disrupt the stability of the Brigade. It is unknown if Dirlewanger hadn't intended to kill the man at all, or if he felt a rare pang of mercy in his heart, but the officer walked away from the incident with nothing more than a fear of being castrated and a constant feeling of imminent execution by Dirlewanger's own hands. Perhaps a stern reprimand was all the man needed."

 ORS.306.b:0 "To the front lines with you!"

 ORS.307.t:0 "A Lack of Faith"
 ORS.307.d:0 "The concern amongst officers from the earlier demotion has led to a group of three officers, seeking safety in numbers, to voice their concerns to Dirlewanger himself over his treatment of officers when they make so called 'slight errors'. The triad of officers believe that it was unfair to demote the last offender, instead stating that Dirlewanger should've wrapped up his punitive action with the execution of the bravado filled soldier that was the true culprit for this whole mess. Not necessarily advocating for promoting that officer back to his former position, the three officers instead ask for an assurance of job security in the face of so called minor blunders that they may find themselves wrapped up in. Once again, a request to Dirlewanger leaves him in a position to set further precedent for how the Brigade should act towards the mistakes and inadequacies from those in charge. The officers gulp and shift uneasily, silently praying to themselves that Dirlewanger doesn't sign their death warrant right then and there. Dirlewanger is left to decide."

 ORS.308.d:0 "The efforts of the three officers seem to have paid off for the officers as a whole, as their arguments have led to Dirlewanger judging their actions with a bit less malice than ever experienced before. With a bit more freedom in their actions, and a lot less fear of being put down and shuffled out, the officers have begun to breathe easier. With this newfound lightening of the weight on their shoulders, a general increase of morale has spread from the officers themselves to the soldiers under their command, something appreciated throughout the entire camp as everyone seems to have an extra spring in their step on their way to plunder yet another fearful town of innocent Russians. Perhaps ruling entirely through fear can only take you so far, the officers are left to think, and perhaps the occasional benefit or ounce of freedom is beneficial for the overall effectiveness of your force. In any case, with morale up and attitude improved, the officers can command a bit more effectively as they carve a bloody, rich path across the Southern Urals and beyond."

As another three officers lie dead for dissenting from Dirlewanger's will, hasty replacements were set up to fill their now empty positions. One of these new officers, a former raider with no command experience and only a decent record of slaughter to his name, has caused yet more problems amongst the soldiers. When this new officer sought to flex his new position by taking command of the raid of a small village, he was utterly embarrassed. Reports state that this young officer's orders featured such tactically sound commands as "Charge!", and "Kill everyone!". Of course, when the villagers proved to be more than living scarecrows, his command faltered shamefully.\n\nNow, the men once again complain to Dirlewanger. The constant rotation of execution over the slightest objections, dissensions, and mistakes has caused a severe lack in command prowess among the Brigade. Now that complaints are in such numbers that they can't be solved with a few bullets, Dirlewanger seems to have backed himself into a wall and has unfortunately damaged the strength of his own army. For now, only time will tell if this will end up seriously hindering the efforts of the Brigade's raids, or even the coming war effort against the Ural League. In the meantime, it seems another officer will have to be shot."

 ORS.310.d:0 "After the execution of the bold soldier who caused a ruckus amongst the Brigade, a decision was made to posthumously look into his 'evidence' to see if his words had any merit, even after death. The subsequent investigation into these matters revealed a highly disturbing trend that did not simply die with the man, but one that has infected many of those that sat in the man's division. Within the battalion of the now dead soldier now lies a disturbing, perhaps even communist sentiment.\n\nWhile that man yet lived, his ideas of spreading the plunder more equally permeated many of the soldiers he fought alongside, and investigative action has revealed the communist, despicable, bolshevik, downright opposite to moral ideas that maybe the soldiers should receive a greater share of what they manually loot and steal for themselves.\n\nOf course, this trend is downright alarming, if not completely sinister in nature. Alas, with the circumstances, one is led to wonder why the officers of this battalion did not find it prudent to clamp down on such ideas, especially with the relative ease of which these red Russian ideas were discovered. Two courses of action seem equally appropriate in response; of course, the simple solution would be to remove this radical Marxist thought with the cracks of a rifle, but that could be viewed as a waste of manpower and ammunition. It may be equally advisable to find out why exactly the officers have not already taken care of this, and perhaps find the source of the problem."

 ORS.311.d:0 "The decision to interrogate the officers of the newly discovered 'Bolshevik Battalion' proved to be wise, if only because it produced a harrowing discovery. When the officers were isolated and asked about the disconcerting ideas of their men, the officers eventually let it slip that even they somewhat take the ideas of their men into account. Even worse, the officers claim that such ideas are not isolated to a single battalion of the Dirlewanger Brigade, but are in fact quite common amongst Dirlewanger's entire army! The officers go so far as to claim that it is only the top echelons, Dirlewanger and his closest generals, that believe that the officers should be taking most of the spoils for themselves.\n\nConfronted with such radical, absurd ideas, Dirlewanger is left to wonder if this is all an audacious ploy to make these dissident ideas seem far more spread than they really are, or if this is a real problem that has found itself slithering around the minds of what used to be such brutal, compliant pillagers. After all, such a bluff could be a Bolshevik plot to force Dirlewanger to accept such ideas, when they do not have precedent in reality. On the other hand, the traitor officers could unfortunately be correct, which may place the entire future of the Dirlewanger Brigade in jeopardy! If the Dirlewanger Brigade is to continue its existence, a decision will have to be made to prevent the extremist ideas of loot sharing from spreading. Dirlewanger is left to make a decision on their next move, of course, after splattering these officer's heads on the ground."

While fortunate, the officers did end up wasting significant time and energy searching, interrogating, and shooting our way into the minds of our own men to discover the truth behind these matters. In any case, the Brigade can be sure that the truly evil ideas of sharing amongst ourselves has been stamped out once and for all amongst the men. The fate of the extreme leftist battalion is one of mercy, as to conserve manpower, they have all been forced at gunpoint to renounce their beliefs or be turned into a sludge of grey matter. Of course, the battalion is now no threat to us, their leadership replaced with a stern loyalist and their cursed beliefs humiliated in front of all of them. The Dirlewanger Brigade is thankfully free of the influence spread by the degenerate former Soviet land, and Dirlewanger is most pleased that their efforts to slaughter and plunder all in their path can proceed fresh and unimpeded."

 ORS.313.d:0 "Once again it was wise to look deeper into the post-mortem characteristics of our men. To our detriment, it seems that the officers did not lie at all about the presence of foul Communists in our ranks, and their extent has reached a point where Dirlewanger and his loyal generals can not simply gun down every single transgressor without mercy. It is a common, dreadful sentiment amongst a majority of our men that loot should be shared to the individual achievement of the raiders, and that sentiment is a firm belief in the hearts of our men. The shock and rage present in Dirlewanger is palpable, and the only thing stopping him from going on a killing spree is the necessity of manpower for his grand plans to loot and plunder every single square inch of the Southern Urals and beyond.\n\nLamentably, this means that Dirlewanger is faced with two options to continue the further existence of his brigade. Of course, he can step away from the investigation, and pretend that he never found out about such contemptible ideas present in his men. Then, there is the second option; a step into the darkness that seems to have fallen over all of his men. Perhaps stability would be easiest found if Dirlewanger took some of their ideas in account. While utterly vile, it would be likely to produce an increase of morale in the men, something that may improve effectiveness for our great conquest. It is simply deplorable that the men have found idiotic minds of their own, but yet Dirlewanger stands, forced to take into account the wishes of his band of executioners."

Any pang of mercy that appeared to be present during their last confrontation was visible no longer, as Dirlewanger ordered for a few raiders to guide the officer to the middle of the Brigade's camp, ensuring the maximum visibility for whatever he had planned. As the officer was dragged along to his destination, Dirlewanger made sure to lay into the officer once again, ridiculing him all the way to his stop. The officer's life was officially turned into an example for all of those who, intentionally or not, cause issues for the stability and function of the Brigade's existence.

With little to do, his eyes scanned the space for something to occupy himself, when his gaze fell upon his trusty rifle.\n\nIt was an ancient thing, really. A standard issue Karabiner 98k, one he had owned since his days still on the Reich's leash. Yet despite his men continually acquiring new weapons in their bloody raids, he had kept it and maintained his rifle all these years, and continued to use it to deadly effect. Sitting down with it on the dirty fur mats he used for a bed, he began carefully polishing the grime off of its worn surface.\n\nAs he worked, his mind wandered backwards in time. He traced the rusty trigger, and remembered how his finger had click, click, clicked it in the faces of Speidel's traitorous men, blowing their empty skulls open across the Russian snow. He polished the barrel, and smirked as he thought back to when his men had first arrived in Orsk, when he thrust it down the throat of the last mayor of the city and almost choked him to death before shredding his innards with a bullet. His fingers rubbed over the scratches on the stock, and he laughed at all the Russian peasants he had simply beaten to bloody pulp with it.\n\nHe held the now relatively clean weapon in front of him. To him, beholding this rifle was like looking in a mirror. It had been with him for as long as he remembered. It was why he kept it with him all this time.\n\nIt was a part of him."

 ORS.316.d:0 "As the raiding party set down to rest in the burned ruins of the latest village to face their wrath, Dirlewanger hopped out of his truck and went to get something from the back. As he approached, he noticed that the mud from the recent rains now caked the side of the vehicle. He looked around the village for some useless sot to foist the responsibility of cleaning the vehicle upon, when he found a group of his men roasting the village animals over a fire.\n\nHis gaze honed in on one particular man who had most displeased him. A Khazakh raider, one who had joined the band recently but had constantly hung back in the raids, keeping himself out of danger yet still happily helping himself to the loot afterwards. Dirlewanger calmly ordered the man to approach. He smiled and offered him a cloth and a bucket, and ordered him to have his truck spotless within the hour.\n\nThe coward's face immediately went white, and Dirlewanger's smile grew all the wider. A few of the other men present began to cackle at the poor man, who immediately set to furiously scrubbing the mud off of the weather-beaten metal. Dirlewanger chuckled and wandered off into the village to find loot or some captives to entertain himself with, leaving the man to work like his life depended upon it."

The sides were now completely free of mud, the dust had been polished off the windscreen, and even the interior had been cleared of grime. Dirlewanger checked it all over, once, twice, three times. Finally he approached the man and thanked him for making his truck cleaner than it had been in a long time.\n\n"Of course, I said I wanted it spotless..." he said, that insidious grin returning to his face. The blood left the raider's face once more as Dirlewanger knelt down and beckoned him to come and look. There, just on the underside of the front left fender, was a tiny leftover spot of mud.\n\nA single sob was all that had time to leave the man's throat before Dirlewanger put his rifle to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. The other men watching laughed as two approached to dump the raider's body with the others. After watching the wretch's corpse go, Dirlewanger turned back to his vehicle, only to groan with frustration at the sight of all the blood now splattered over the door. He turned to the man who had spilled booze over him the other day and barked at him to get the mess cleaned up.\n\nThe same rules applied, as always."

 ORS.318.d:0 "Dirlewanger was deep in his cups when he was interrupted by some of his men barging into his tent. Before he could demand an explanation, they dragged forwards a bloodied, tired and emaciated boy no more than fifteen years old. He had been caught at the edge of the camp where the men had beat him up, until he surprised them all by crying out in fluent German.\n\nThe boy feebly pleaded with Dirlewanger, introducing himself as Otto Wagner. He claimed to be the son of a settler family in Reichskommissariat Moskowien, where he had been a petty thug. He and a group of fellow criminals had fled east after being caught filching weapons from the local garrison, but the wastes and the hostile locals of the lands beyond German control had not been kind to them. He was all that remained of that party, and he had eventually found his way to Orsk after overhearing a group of militiamen talking about a group of German bandits based there.\n\nWhether out of genuine curiosity or simply thanks to being too drunk to care, Dirlewanger decided not to spill the boy's guts to the dirt. Remarking that he must be fine Aryan stock to have made it this far on his own, Dirlewanger told the boy that he could stay within the camp. However, he grabbed the boy close and threatened him never to disrespect his new master.\n\nOtto quickly wiped his tears and quietly thanked Dirlewanger and bid a hasty exit from the tent."

 ORS.319.d:0 "Nearly half a year after Otto Wagner arrived in the camp, he has slowly integrated into life in the Brigade. He does not complain or talk much, even as the older men roughhouse him around and give him the occasional beating. After all, he does not have anywhere else to be, so for the most part he puts up with getting the scraps from the table and generally being the runt of the Brigade.\n\nRecently, Dirlewanger has become tired of managing the day-to-day humdrum of loot distribution and ammo management. He has decided he would much like a secretary, like the big bosses back in Germany would have, to handle all the boring tedious work while they could spend their time out cracking skulls. Perhaps seeking to finally give Otto some purpose, he unceremoniously dumped a pile of ledgers and notebooks in his hands and told him to get to work.\n\nNot daring to disrespect Dirlewanger, the new secretary quickly took to his duties. Satisfied that the boy was no longer sitting around uselessly, Dirlewanger looked for some more depraved activities to involve himself in now that his responsibilities had been delegated away."

 ORS.320.d:0 "Earlier this morning, a batch of captives destined for Lysenko's labs were brought into camp. The bandits herded them into a pen once used to hold cattle before the resident farmer was unceremoniously impaled on the gatepost. Though officially they were supposed to deliver all of those they captured unharmed to the madman on the mountain, the bandits never refrained from an opportunity to have their ways with defenseless innocents.\n\nAmidst the scenes of depravity and gratuitous violence, Dirlewanger's young secretary Otto approached the pen. He was long since desensitized to the Brigade's antics and watched the horror with a dead-eyed stare. It was then that he noticed a small glimmer from the fingers of one of the captives. Eager to prove himself to the bandits and to take some loot, Otto approached the man and ordered him to hand it over. To his surprise, the man refused. He desperately begged Otto to let him keep it, for it was his wedding ring and the only memory he had left of his wife.\n\nOtto punched him.\n\nAs the man collapsed to the floor, some of the bandits cheered him on and told the boy to hit him again. He stood there, contemplating, but the cheers were growing, so he gave the man his boot in the stomach. He bent over and gave the man another punch. Again, and again. The captive begged for mercy as Otto grew more and more furious, but still he refused to hand over his precious ring. Eventually the man lay cold and lifeless on the ground.\n\nFor a brief moment, the boy stared at the corpse in shock, then, he reached down and plucked the trinket from the dead man's finger and held it aloft for all to see. The assembled men roared with delight for their favored son and his first kill."

Storming out of his tent to find out who he had to shoot to get the noise to stop, he came upon a scene of blood. One man lay dead, an ornate knife embedded in his neck, while the boy Otto Wagner lay upon the ground peppered with gunshots and a mangled arm.\n\nDirlewanger furiously demanded to know what had happened, to which one of the men gathered around the scene explained that the two had gotten into a fight over loot. Both had wanted the knife for themselves, and when the elder man refused to relent the boy had viciously attacked him. A struggle ensued in which the man brutally slashed Otto's arm before the boy pulled the blade from his own flesh and dealt the killing blow. Before he lost consciousness, however, the elder had been able to pull out his luger and shoot the boy several times, he had missed the chest, but his arms and shoulders caught bullets all over.The old man was shot immediately for hurting his secretary, and shouted loudly at the men around them complete useless for letting Otto get into trouble like this\n\nAfter Dirlewanger had calmed down, he turned his attention to Otto. The boy was truly in a sorry state. The boy's arms was beyond saving, and he was quickly bleeding out. He would certainly never be useful as a secretary again, though with the limited medical supplies available it was possible he could still be saved and made useful as a cook or something similar. But in such harsh climes and amongst such harsh men, the way to deal with a man no longer needed is often a quick and merciful death. and Dirlewanger eyed up his pistol and considered perhaps just putting the boy out of his misery."

The target is a village of Russian peasants just over the next ridge; having survived through sheer luck and oversights on the Brigade's part-until now. They have little in ways of pure wealth, but they always have full cellars, plenty of vodka, and the occasional silver candlestick or gold ring to loot. All in all, the best pickings a raider could hope for without having to brave armed resistance.\n\nSuddenly, the squad comes to a halt at their leader's signal. He silently points to a shallow ravine, as the men gaze in awe. There, staring at them, is an adult brown bear in the middle of hunting for dinner. The men are frozen, desperately hoping not to break the uneasy silence between them and the beast. Finally, the commander leans over to his second-in-command and whispers "I'll go up to it." His aide stares at him like he's grown a second head, then chambers a round in the worn Mosin-Nagant in his hands. Better to put the beast down before his boss get any more stupid ideas."

The beast immediately slumps over without as much as a whimper, a slow trickle of red dribbling down its head onto the grass. After a brief debate, the guards decide to skin it and bring the pelt back to camp as their spoils-it's certainly a unique prize.\n\nOn the ride back to Orsk, the commander decides to have them stop at another ravine, hoping to give their horses a few minutes to recuperate and find some water. They do not notice a small cave around the bend, nor does the soldier guarding the horses notice three fully-grown brown bears lumbering toward them. However, he certainly notices when it bites down on his neck.\n\nWhen the squad does return to camp, it only consists of three horrified and blood-splattered soldiers riding on the backs of claw-raked horses. Neither the commander or his aide are seen, and none of them are willing to say what happened.

That night, after some discussion with his men (and copious amounts of vodka), the commander decides that he should try climbing on the bear's back and riding it like a horse.

It turns out that Siegfried is not the fastest of mounts, but he can get up to a decent speed for a short amount of time and doesn't even flinch at the sound of gunfire. As the men ride out toward a village, hoping to return with plunder and glory, the other squads cheer with raucous laughter as they see Siegfried lumbering by, with plenty of jokes about the commanding having found himself a Russian woman circulating.\n\nAs the squad nears the village, they hear something that is exhilarating yet unnerving: the sound of gunshots fired by some village militia. While this raid will certainly be more dangerous than the usual ransacking of poor farmers' hovels, the presence of a militia means that they have loot worth defending. The commander spurs Siegfried forward, and the horses beside him accelerate from a trot to a gallop. As the squadron begins to open fire, Siegfried suddenly jolts to a stop and slumps to the ground. The commander scrambles off the beast's back to see what could be wrong. Fortunately, Siegfried is unharmed; it seems he just stumbled on a rock. While the commander is relieved, it does raise some concerns about Siegfried's combat efficiency-bears, after all, are neither as fast nor as agile as horses.

The bullets whiz all around, with the militiamen having retreated behind the windows and alleyways of their village. But the men of the Dirlewanger Brigade are experienced enough to successfully fight back against their enemies, and ride through the streets shooting everything that moves. At the front of the squadron is the commander, leading a roaring Siegfried and spreading chaos in the streets.\n\nFinally, the men prepare a charge against the last stronghold of local resistance: the village's tiny, ramshackle Orthodox church. Although most locals scatter at the sight of over a dozen bandits armed to the teeth galloping towards them, several remain determined to the last and fire off a few more rounds from the rifles before being shot or cut down. Most of those bullets fly by harmlessly-except for one. Having been shot in the head, Siegfried comes to a crashing halt, and the commander is thrown to the ground. He scrambles over to his dying mount, cradles Siegfried's bloodied head, and closes his dark eyes for the last time. The commander stands up, pulls out a pistol, and walks towards the cowering villagers taking refuge in the church with determination in his eyes.\n\nThis one's for Siegfried."

Local guards litter the streets and alleyways, their blood seeping into the dirt. Much of his subsequent duties focus on rounding up and executing military-age prisoners, looting winter food stocks, organizing the fair division of war booty among the men, and burning down the tiny Orthodox church where the town's defenders made their last stand. One of his men had lost a horse during the charge, but that was of little concern at the moment as the men were going house-to-house and grabbing whatever, or whoever, caught their eye. This town was a rather ripe reward; the commander himself had gotten a gold-plated pocket watch, a bottle of brandy, a new pistol, a silver Communion chalice from the church, and a few stacks of old Soviet rubles (having long lost their monetary value, but being wonderful firestarters).\n\nOnce the men had their fun, they began making their way back to camp. But as they near the spot where they left Siegfried, the bear was nowhere in sight. There's no blood or sign of a fight, but there are tracks leading off in the direction of the cave where they first found him. Siegfried was wild, after all, and it would be foolish to try and contain him for too long. With a heavy heart, the commander tells his men to ride onwards, knowing that it was probably the last any of them would see of Siegfried the cavalry bear."

 ORS.331.t:0 "A Brilliant Proposal"
 ORS.331.d1:0 "The great, brooding mind of Oskar Dirlewanger had borne a brilliant proposal surely beneficial to his elite retinue; removing the Sieg Heil. Dirlewanger was a man of action, ill-suited to the hamfisted social engineering of the Roman salute. This troop contingent after all was not ever going to be needed for flag waving or flattering superiors; here every man was his own master, master of creating a destiny and legacy for him and his men to follow. Fear as a form of control had always worked on those he had terrorised, so as a logical conclusion it should also work on his men if they rejected his idea.\n\nIn his delusion the crazed officer, who could have likely been a successful Landsknecht in a time both different and too similar to this one, had forgotten the reason his former masters had secured utter subservience from their underlings. The regimentation and drilling had created soldiers of iron wills, and even if they represented their ancestors who likewise pillaged Central Europe with horrifying fidelity, believing them to have the ability to murder and rape for the same reasons was utterly foolish.\n\nThe brilliant strategist had given his all-powerful decree; now he watched it fall into ruin. Every time he gathered his men around him now they stood straight to attention, arms raised at the infamous angle and roared the mantra, some even with smirks on their faces. The non-Germans began to join in, peer pressure blinding them to what they were doing and its meaning to their peoples. Even more worryingly, some of the more senior veterans of his brigade now began to almost take less notice of him, punishing violators of his supreme will with suspicious laxity. But he was still the indispensable commander that would lead his men to glory, so this was but a minor setback. Or was he? His aging mind was playing cruel tricks on him in his clear times before the mist of madness descended again."
 ORS.331.d2:0 "Dirlewanger was a veteran, having served in the Deutschvölkischen Schutz- and Trutzbund, then the SA and NSDAP, finally the SS. His desertion from the glorious Reich in its hour of need was not because of dismissal or hatred for the nation; his resentment of certain Wehrmacht staff would not change his love and yearning for his homeland. And so the decision to keep the tradition of the Sieg Heil, a unifier of Germans worldwide, was a simple one for him, despite having a large foreign presence in his army. When announcing the decision to his troops, he was disconcerted to find reluctance, apathy, even subtle opposition in his ranks. In an effort to uphold his iron authority over the brigade he raised his skinny arm and clicked his heels with the intensity of a much younger man.\n\n"SIEG HEIL!" he screamed, eyes bulging, a single vein on the edge of bursting near his grey hairline. To his dismay and seething anger a few men began to snigger, but most of those gathered around his makeshift platform continued to stare at him with something almost resembling curiosity. The tainted man, half-drowned in madness, had forgotten who he now led. The pure fanaticism had been transformed into bitter cynicism by the Russian wastes, diluting the SS brigade it had once been with men of opportunity and desperation. These were men neither of ideology nor religion; a grouping of nihilistic looters who lived from day to day had no motivation to uphold tradition that had abandoned or abused them mercilessly. Dirlewanger stepped of the podium in silence; punishment would have to follow. His quiet mutterings were lost in the din of his troops reverting back to what they had been previously doing before the former SS officer had given his address, something they were proudly good at, pillaging and raping the small, ruined Russian village."

Their morality eroded to cynical nihilism, one even Nietzsche would have raised his eyebrows at, no longer rooted to any ethical order but their own. Within this shift lay a twisted birth, the mother being the sadistic joy of hearing lost souls begging for mercy as they were raped and tortured, the father being the thrill of death knocking on one's door on a near-daily basis. The endless violence had implanted in the brigade the idea to reject Nazism, certainly a defiled, degenerate ideology, yet still with traditions that withheld certain desires and behaviors.\n\nDirlewanger, despite having deep and even affectionate ties to the twisted ideology that had brought Germany to the heights he had exploited, felt his and the roots of the former SS members of the brigade slowly being replanted into the fertile ground of the banditry of the non-German recruits. In an unsurprising move the alcoholic, sexual deviant of a commander, abolished, or rather forgot, the Sieg Heil, a greeting synonymous with conformity and strict discipline. He was not a man that required the groveling and intricate power play of the Führer, nor were these the times of a settled, organized existence; these were the times of pleasure filled pillage.

The Russian and other ethnic groups that had joined the wandering bandits were often savagely harassed by German SS troopers in their own ranks who had fallen into old routines, only to then be falsely accused and punished by their officers.\n\nYes, the old spectre of Nazism still clung to the hearts and minds of the former 36th Waffengrenadiere. It was difficult to peel off with the weight of traditions accrued to it like barnacles to a wreck, such as the Sieg Heil salute. Dirlewanger had briefly pondered whether it had outlived its functionality but had decided to keep it, to the silent chagrin of the non-German bandits and great elation of the 'aryans'.

Named after its inventor, the Oskarwagen would become a motorized arsenal of fear and firepower, with a cannon large enough to turn a farm into a forest of woodsplinters. When such divine inspiration hit Dirlewanger, he knew he had to act. Immediately, he ordered four of his burliest brutes to mount the largest gun in their stockpile atop his truck.

The 1st Oskarwagen division was given a high rank in the order of battle, a term that didn't play any role in Dirlewanger's plans, so that they plan and execute raids without grumpy officers telling them no. This division, but more on the size of a large brigade, would answer only to Dirlewanger himself. The two trucks had already proven themselves in raids, and with an organized structure revolving around the trucks, the 36th were motivated and expected the loot to soon flow in from all possible sources!"

 ORS.342.d:0 "In a fit of rage that managed to somehow surprise the entire brigade, Oskar Dirlewanger has called for a systematic headcount of every soldier, brigand, and bandit under his command. While such a census had been attempted two years before, it had resulted in completely useless data, the brigade's men seemingly too erratic to be tracked with mere numbers. Despite this previous failure, Dirlewanger doubled down when he was questioned by some brave souls, and with a low growl exclaimed "If you won't count them, then I'll shoot every last one of my men and count the corpses myself."\n\nThis level of urgency has never marked previous headcounts, and almost every bandit has his own personal speculation on why the count is being carried out. The leader himself wouldn't give any answer more solid than just calling it a hunch, which is not making the few soldiers with administrative skills any more confident about the necessity of all this. However, the one thing they fear more than dull bureaucratic work is the wrath of the bandit king, and while everyone might drag their feet, the headcount will nonetheless be carried out soon. It remains to be seen if Dirlewanger's peculiar hunch carries any weight."

 ORS.344.d:0 "After long days of searching pass without results, a large group amounting to just short of half of the missing men has been found on the outskirts of the brigade's area of terror. This group was found camping in a village they had recently sacked, picking through the remains and performing the usual unspeakable cruelties on those they had captured. Upon being questioned by the search party, the perplexed leaders among them claimed it had just been a routine raid, but after the most basic of investigations it became obvious that they were trying to conceal what they had gained and not give the usual cut to Dirlewanger. Trying to cut a profit without including the bandit king. A grave mistake.\n\nThis obviously could not stand. Bruised and bloody they were dragged screaming all the way back to Dirlewanger himself, and not only were they forced to give up the entirety of their earnings, they were required to beg for mercy personally. The mad Württemberger went down the entire line of the quivering 130 men, listening to their sobbing and pleading, executing a few seemingly at random until he reached the end. Those would-be deserters better have learned their lesson."

 ORS.345.d:0 "The search for the missing men has turned up something useful once more as fifty more brigands were discovered in Kazakhstan. It seems these ones had no intention to desert and were simply out raiding when the headcount was taken. They had been tracking a caravan of Kazakh villagers, who had led them to a nearly undefended, bountiful town. They had gained considerable spoils and captives in their cruel ransacking, a little celebrating until the search party turned up was therefore not entirely unreasonable. When they were ordered to return back to the brigade, no complaints were noted at first, however it soon became clear that they had intended to keep all their loot to themselves. This led to heated arguments on the way home and even a rather wasteful amount of bloodshed. Upon their return Dirlewanger was dutifully informed of their ill intentions, his fury barely containable. He demanded they turn over the proper share as usual. In an unusually brazen act of defiance, they refused right to his madness contorted face. The cracking mask of humanity finally peeled entirely to reveal a seething insanity as he ordered all of them to be executed as traitors and their loot turned over to him personally. The scene afterwards was brutal and ended with all defiant bandits mutilated to a point where even their mothers would not recognize them."

 ORS.346.d:0 "As Dirlewanger's men surged through the Black Mountain, they encountered a few familiar faces. It seems that about fifty men who were once bandits in the brigade were trapped in the catacombs of the dark mount, many of them already dead, others trapped, many found in different stages of experimentation. Their pitiful pleas for death granted by the unjudging crack of the bandit's guns. A few had avoided this disgustingly cruel fate and had been working for Lysenko as guards, but these lucky ones were definitely a minority. One soldier thought to check the men against the list of missing men from the headcount a while back, and sure enough these fifty were on there. They had finally been found, though it was too late for many. Those that were still alive were mostly allowed to re-join the brigade, and they told many a horror story of the experiments and madness of Lysenko. The ones who had become guards were declared traitors and taken as captives, lined up in neat rows with each second one shot. The spared ones, faces covered in snot and tears, had to drag a dead comrade each into the mountain cells they had guarded. Their fates will likely be unfortunate as all they will be able to feast upon are the bodies of their former friends. Examples have to be set to maintain an iron grip. Even with this find so long after the headcount, there are still some names on the list yet to be found."

These were the ones who had deserted and joined other, lesser bandit groups. As some of these groups were destroyed or absorbed into Dirlewanger's brigade, the missing men were rediscovered and given appropriate punishments for desertion. Some of these men had been missing for years, and the fact that they were found by complete and utter luck shows that it's likely that many of the men missing from the headcount simply deserted, and that a few might not ever be found. Some might already be hundreds or thousands of miles away, having raided and migrated to other regions of chaotic Russia. However, we still managed to find these men who had been missing for so long, and that on its own still qualifies as an accomplishment."

 ORS.348.d:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger rummaged through the papers in front of him, searching for an old map of Russia that he had been fond of. It showed all of the villages that had been raided as of a few years ago marked with a little penned cross. He wanted to see which might have had enough time to recover so that they could be attacked again. As he searched, his eyes were caught by another set of old papers that were in the pile. He pulled them out from under a stack of extremely outdated bomb schematics to see what they were. It was a list of names, each one crossed out in either black or red ink. Dirlewanger smiled. It was the years-old list of people who had been missing from the headcount. He read through the pages, looking at each name, but his smile fell away from his face when he got to the third page. There were a few names that were not crossed out but rather circled. The lost that had never been discovered. He counted the uncircled names, which amounted to about fifty.\n\nDirlewanger tossed the papers aside, annoyed, but as he continued to rummage he just couldn't focus. How dare they have run from him, and gotten away with it too! Oh, if only he could know their exact locations, find each of them, punish them personally...he fantasized about hangings, shootings, torture, screams for mercy. He couldn't focus on finding the map anymore. He snatched the old list and went to find someone who could do something about this. These people wouldn't be free yet. No one was free from him."

The former citizenry, regardless of age or circumstance, were mercilessly butchered by the warriors of darkness, their corpses searched thoroughly for items of wealth prior to their careless discardment in the ashes of what was once 'home'. The raid had been overwhelmingly successful, and as the deranged warriors began to indulge themselves in the fruits of their labor, further horrendous and unspeakable acts of degeneracy occurred against the deceased.\n\nHours following the orgy of violence, the fatigued warriors rested at the village entrance, emotionally and mentally exhausted from the day's bloodshed and degeneracy. By nightfall an odd serenity filled the air, peace reigned at last. However, the silence of the night was shattered, as the warrior's commander arrived at the former-village. As Oberführer Dirlewanger approached the resting men, his deranged face illuminated by torchlight, he let out a blood curdling scream, causing his men to suddenly awake. As they stumbled to their feet, the Oberführer declared it was time for their weapons inspection, the shocked and fatigued men would quickly shuffling into place as the inspection commenced.\n\nThe Oberführer went man by man, displeased, inspecting their weaponry, continuously hurling abuse at his loyal warriors. The soldiers stood there, petrified beyond belief, as Dirlewanger would stand in silent observation. After minutes of contemplation, he raised his right hand and selected several soldiers from the line. From the curtain of darkness, a firing squad emerged, who mechanically raised their weapons and aimed to slaughter the chosen men. Yet despite this, the Oberführer wasn't satisfied yet. He called over the raid commander and his subordinate, and exchanged brief but tense words as Dirlewanger questioned the men. Despite the fact both men possessed significant talent, Dirlewanger pondered about executing both of them to serve a further example to those spared the previous executions..."

As they pillaged every chamber, the substantial art collection it held was treated with utter indifference by the drunken raiders, smashing work after work with no restraint. But for a moment, the decimation ceased as they saw an elderly man standing in front of one painting, sobbing and pleading for its mercy. "Old bastard, what is this?" Dirlewanger barked in confusion.\n\nThe man collapsed onto his knees, begging for his father's magnum opus to be spared. The band looked upon the abstract, meaningless composition, their faces sneering with disgust. "It's just a fucking black square!" a brigadier howled, prompting voracious laughter. They readied their rifles and began to volley hundreds of rounds towards the man and the degenerate art, shredding its paint and tearing its linen. The rampage soon continued until they ended with a lit match.\n\nAs the mansion went up in flames, one of the soldiers saw something in the smoke. Something that appeared to distinguish itself powerfully from the rest, an apparition that contrasted with the sky so severely that it was impossible for a more perfect, more supreme polarity to ever be imagined.

In the cellar of an old distillery, they found a gigantic stash of alcoholic beverages that somehow had not been looted in the decades since Russia's collapse. Returning home with a mountain of loot and captives, Dirlewanger proclaimed that the night would see the greatest party in the history of Russia.\n\nThe vodka flowed freely and the loot was spread far and wide. Quickly the men of the Brigade became heavily inebriated, losing whatever remaining restraint they had left. As the sun set, the camp descended into a cacophony of wild celebration, senseless violence and unspeakable debauchery. The captives were brutalized even more than the normal fare for the band, and by morning few would remain alive and even fewer would be happy to be. The night soon devolved into a further haze of chaos as brawls broke out over the dwindling alcohol. For the first time in decades, the streets of Orsk were alive, albeit with the sound of jeers, screams and death.\n\nAs the overcast sky began to lighten with the dawn, the men of the Brigade awoke disheveled, hungover and surly. Blood, feces, and other fluids lay splattered throughout the streets, and the bodies of those killed by either the chaos of the night or by simple alcohol poisoning littered the ground here and there. Minimal effort was made to clean the place, and soon the bandits simply returned to their more cohesive roles of brutality, hoping to avoid incurring the wrath of Dirlewanger and his splitting headache."

The village was filled with shouting and commotion as the terrified townsfolk gathered everything they could carry and rushed out on to the road to safety. Women and children carried precious heirlooms, things carried in their families for decades or even centuries.\n\nAs their wives and children evacuated, the men were shouting and receiving orders, tossing guns to one another and inspecting the weapons they'd be using. Many of the firearms were in a sorry state, not used since the World War and intended only for hunting. Still, a gun was a gun, and even those with hunting rifles made no complaints. They just loaded their weapons and eyed their meager allocation of ammunition nervously. Their stockpile was small enough already, and they still had to make sure they saved one bullet in case of the worst.\n\nThe men looked grim as they took up their positions. Deep down, they all knew they would not live. This was, barring divine intervention, their final stand. Though they could not save themselves, they could still make time for their families. They would make sure their own deaths were the slowest possible as long as it meant they could aim another shot and pull the trigger again.\n\nIn the distance, the faintest hum of motors started to be heard. The makeshift militiamen all fell silent. All that could be heard were heavy vehicles, and the lone, sad song of a solitary bird.

The former crack SS troopers and ruthless Russian bandits were now a sorry after-image of their former fear and awe inspiring power, yet still retained their gruesome rejection of any normal moral standards. Not a single poor soul had been left alive after the bandit plague had washed over the small rural community in their search for a suitable place to face their downfall.\n\nSome of their number had deserted, others had been executed, now all that remained were the most determined and steadfast killers that the brigade could offer. Despite this, the men gathering in the strategically untouched village square began to have their first doubts over the outcome of tomorrow's battle. Their numbers had been thinned to an extent worse than at any other time during their rapacious rampage through the Russian plains.

On the contrary, many of them relished in their looting and raping of the Russian wastes. But there were other things they did to pass time, much to the relief of the surrounding villages.\n\nWhat started with a German soldier coming up with an idea for a new drinking game, and the Russian contingent supplying stolen vodka, became a great new tradition. It would be something repeated by the brigade for a long time to come, and in later years, unscrupulous American college fraternities. The true nature of the game will be lost to time, but future renditions will generally agree that a live pigeon, an ink quill, and an anthill are all involved.\n\nSoon after on that fateful first night, the "game" part of the celebration quickly ended, and dissolved into a wild, debaucherous party the likes of which had not been seen in years.

As the two bandits rolled around in the mud drunkenly screaming obscenities and threats at one another, they quickly became the spectacle for all their fellow soldiers that evening.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot cut through the night, bringing the revelry to a sudden halt. One of the fighters knelt on the ground, staring dumbfound at the Nagant revolver that had somehow made its way into his hands. His opponent was lying facedown, a trickle of blood running out of his mouth. The surviving fighter staggered upright and prodded his unfortunate rival with the toe of his boot, slurring "Vanya?

It was then that they saw him.\n\nIn the long grass about fifty meters away was one of those goody-two-shoes Ural Guards, watching the party and presumably counting their numbers to report back. Seeing that he had been spotted, the nameless soldier quickly but calmly sprung from his position and began to retreat over the ridge behind him. Udo, a man who was as supremely violent as he was mentally addled by years of substance abuse, roared with delight at the prospect of an easy kill and gave chase. Not wishing to be left out of the bloodsport, Jörg and the rest speedily followed.\n\nThe hunt was on.\n\nThe men were eager and their weapons were quickly drawn, but the soldier was surprisingly agile as he ducked and weaved amongst the rocks and trees.

Emerging into a small field alongside some old barracks, they soon realized that they were in a rather extensive compound. Their target could be anywhere, and if they were not careful he could simply slip past them and wander out the way they came. Ralf then had the idea to split up and fan out across the compound. The sooner they could locate him, the sooner they could all converge and beat the daylights out of him, after all.\n\nThe men agreed. Jörg, Marc and Ralf agreed to search the barracks, while Günter took Udo to investigate the admin building. When Ershat moved to follow them, Jörg shoved him back and had him guard the gate to make sure their quarry didn't get out that way. If he did try the gate again, they would easily be able to find him by the sound of the Kazakh's screams. Their roles assigned, the three groups split up to hunt for the nameless soldier.\n\nNot one of them noticed the soldier in shadow, peering down at them from the old watch tower.

He could head south, and take up residence with whoever controlled Kazakhstan these days.\n\nOf course, Ershat was a coward who clung to the Brigade because he would rather be with them than against them. So he did as he was told. As always.\n\nSuddenly, his attention was caught by the creaking of wood. Spinning to the source, he saw a dark figure quickly disappear into a small toolshed, the door falling shut behind it. At last, a chance to prove himself! Ershat charged to the shed, preparing to overpower the soldier and present his quarry to those haughty Germans. Busting through the door, he raised his sabre ready to strike, and -\n\nThe shed was empty. There were no windows, and aside from a few piles of old tools there was nowhere to hide. Ershat gazed in furious disbelief at the space, humiliated at his own foolishness and beginning to consider if the Germans had a point.\n\nIt was at that moment he had the strangest inclination to look up.\n\nThere, held up by all four limbs against the walls of the shed, was that infernal soldier, his masked face staring blankly down at him from above.

Günter half considered finally killing him and blaming it on the soldier, if Udo were not so freakishly and brutally strong that he might tear him in two.\n\nAs they searched the upper floor, Günter glanced out the window and scanned the camp. It was then he noticed Ershat was no longer at the gate. His foul mood deepened as he made a mental note to relieve the useless Kazakh of several teeth once they regrouped. It was then his ears caught the ever so subtle cracking and splintering of wood from the stairwell. His dash to investigate was interrupted, however, as he almost tripped over the knelt down form of Udo giggling over some leftover nude photographs.\n\nJust before he finally snapped and brained the idiot, his eyes darted to the stairwell and locked directly with the unknown soldier, staring at him with no visible emotion. The two bandits almost simultaneously darted for him, but they would never reach him. With a sudden snap the floor beneath them gave way, and the two plunged down to the first floor. The impact was so great, they broke through this floor as well, landing in a heap on the ground floor.\n\nGünter screamed out in pain, his arm and leg broken in multiple places. Udo lay spasming, a huge splinter of wood penetrating his brain. As Günter cried out for help, the soldier descended the stairs, tossing aside the saw he had used to weaken the boards.

It was just one soldier, after all, what harm could he do versus the wolves of Germany? Entering the dank and musty shower quarters, he tried each shower in turn. Disappointment built as one by one each failed to produce its promised stream, until finally one of them miraculously had a small amount of water left in its tank. The trickle was meager and very cold, but for a bandit so dirtied with filth and the stain of his sins it was a refreshing relief.\n\nAs Ralf washed the water over his face and down his arms, he was blissfully unaware of the figure slowly creeping behind him. Too late did he catch sight of a shadow on the wall, cast by the light through the entry doorway. The shadow of a blade raised to strike. He spun around just in time for the blade to plunge into his chest. The ceaseless masked figure raised his blade and plunged it down again. And again. And again. Ralf screamed in agony, his feeble resistance growing weaker and weaker with each blow.\n\nAs he finally slumped down to the ground, life ebbing away, Ralf watched as the figure calmly turned from the macabre scene and walked out the door.

However, Marc was not quick enough as a bullet slammed into his leg and sent him tumbling to the ground.\n\nAs Marc screamed in pain, Jörg turned just in time to see the soldier emerging and striding with unnatural confidence towards them. He pulled his luger up to fire, but cursed as the empty gun merely clicked in his hands. Falling back behind the nearest building, he began to reload, only to realize that he had left his extra ammunition with the raiding party supply.\n\nMarc writhed on the floor as the figure approached.

He forgot, of course, that his opponent was wearing that thick visored helmet of the Guard. The only reaction from the soldier was a mild grunt of surprise.

Being aware that for their most horrible crimes no sane communities would accept their presence, the scientists attempted to find refuge in Dirlewanger's camps, believing that the Black Bandit will find a use of their knowledge and will spare them of death.\n\nUpon learning about his new guests, Dirlewanger immediately ordered his men to seize the whole belongings of the scientists and spread them across the camp and tasked his new minions to start mass production of weaponry and supplies, while treating his new servants even lower than slaves. Undoubtedly, Dirlewanger took a sadistic pleasure in the whole process, as he now he has under his cruel thumb the very same people who mocked him for being an illiterate barbarian.

Next to the head were the burned remains of his uniform, the stench of urine making it clear that it had been quite ruined even before the immolation.

Allowing them to get a few clumsy swings in, Dirlewanger roared with laughter as he effortlessly dodged their attacks several times. So lost was he in his own mirth, that he did not react as the peasant finally swung true, caving in the Bandit's skull and putting an end to the most wretched man in Russia.\n\nThe brave peasant quickly made their escape, and upon discovering the demise of their leader, the raiding party quickly fell into bickering and bloody infighting. Without Dirlewanger, the once terrifying band of ne'er-do-wells has shattered, and are not expected to trouble the people of the Russian steppes any longer."

It would seem a petty dispute over loot was blown far out of proportion, with many of the senior members of the Brigade heatedly arguing with each other to the point of coming to blows. Already in an even fouler mood than usual, Dirlewanger exploded at his men, calling them all 'sons of whore dogs' amongst other choice insults and proclaimed that as their leader, he would receive all the loot.\n\nThis clearly caused a few of the men to finally snap, for later that night as Dirlewanger was out relieving himself, he was ambushed by nearly a dozen figures and stabbed innumerable times. As his life ebbed away, Dirlewanger realized that these were all the same men he had insulted for the final time mere hours previously, apparently led by his own second-in-command, Fritz Schmedes. When Schmedes gleefully went in for the coup de grace, all Dirlewanger could do before his world went dark was feebly curse his men for their ultimate betrayal.\n\nSchmedes then attempted to take control of the Brigade, but fortunately for the people of Russia, many of the bandits refused to recognize his leadership, and violence quickly broke out. Various factions within the Brigade have splintered off and disappeared into the depths of Siberia, and what is left is a mere shadow of what was once a band of nightmares."

Upon closer inspection by some of the Brigade's mechanics, they confirmed that it was a Komet rocket fighter, likely shot down during the West Russian war. It seems that Lysenko had his minions recover the wreck, haul it to Black Mountain, disassemble it for study, and then repair it to working order. Even more impressively, the mechanics verified that it was fully functional.\n\nOf course, Dirlewanger could not help but organize an impromptu flight show to display the power of the Brigade's new one-man air force. A quantity of sufficient fuel was amassed, a former Russian pilot volunteered, and a makeshift viewing pavilion was erected in an empty field outside of Magnitogorsk. As the Komet took off with a roar, Dirlewanger and the other commanders watched with glee as the rocket fighter did basic maneuvers with blinding speed across a clear sky. But as the pilot attempted to show off his skills and do a barrel roll, something went wrong. Smoke began pouring from the engine, and the fighter spun out of control and began hurtling to the ground at a breakneck pace. It slammed into the ground at hundreds of miles per hour, incinerating everything beneath it-which happened to be the viewing pavilion.\n\nAs the men nervously searched the smoking wreckage, all they found of their leader were clumps of charred bone and shrapnel, too pulverized to even conclusively identify as his remains."

The battle would conclude with the soldier pretending that one of Dirlewanger's punches had connected and knocked them to the ground. However, this time the battle went awry as Dirlewanger elected to instead pull the man towards him. The commander was already unsteady from the copious amount of alcohol he had consumed and the added weight of the soldier only quickened his fall to the ground. This only elicited some careful chuckles from the surrounding soldiers. The soldier fell with his knee right on Dirlewanger's chest, which resulted in a distinct crunch. The Commander did not seem to react to this and simply staggered back to his feet. While the soldier knew that he had likely cracked his ribs, he decided that it was best to simply not mention it and get off scot-free. Instead, he approached Dirlewanger again and patted him on the back as a gesture of goodwill after the fight. The second slap produced another crunch which stopped the brigade leader in his tracks.

But as they traveled on, Dirlewanger became separated and soon found himself without direction or bearing. But, as fortune has it, he stumbled upon a local village girl walking to her Babushka's house. Asking for directions, he uncovered the location and soon sped away. When the young girl arrived, she noticed her Babushka, cooking potatoes. Strangely enough, her Babushka had grown a stubble since she had last seen her. And gained some weight. Most surprising of all, her Babushka had grown a full set of teeth back! The young girl then noticed a hand sticking under her Babushka's bed. The intrepid girl distracted her Babushka which inane questions, all while grabbing her handy rifle. Her Babushka smiled upon seeing the girl holding the rifle. 'Now now, what do you have that for? Young girls like you shouldn't have rifles that are for big men like me- I mean for big men like soldiers.' Her Babushka said, smiling with those sharp, rotting teeth. The young lady replied 'I was just going to do some target practice. These roads aren't often tread by little girls like me.' Again, her Babushka smiled. 'Come here, little girl, I'll join you. I may be an old lady, but I know more then you might catch on.' The girl pulled up her rifle to her shoulder and pointed it at Dirlewanger. At the same moment, Dirlewanger lunged. Before his claws could reach her, he was shot dead."

However, what they did not expect was for their leader to miss his first shot, and to soon after be mauled by one of the creatures. While the boar was killed and Dirlewanger dragged back to camp, it soon became clear that the medical attention he needed was not going to be discovered, and Dirlewanger soon died of his wounds.

Of course, this was nothing more than a roving band of drunk and well-armed brigands who would search houses, seize anything of value, and declare it a tax for the new administration.\n\nIn a rare moment of common sense, Dirlewanger realized that keeping this up would lead to a mass revolt of the surviving townsfolk, one that not even the entire Brigade could resist. So, he ordered a grisly execution for his police chief, an especially cruel Cossack named Ruslan Orlov, and had the mutilated body dumped on the street in front of the city hall. It seems that Dirlewanger was attempting to steal a page from Machiavelli's playbook, where a prince appointed a cruel magistrate to pacify a city; after the city was bloodily brought to heel, the prince executed the magistrate and left the townspeople "satisfied and stupefied."\n\nOf course, Dirlewanger greatly overestimated the amount of goodwill that Orlov's execution would bring him, as he found out the hard way when he visited Orenburg once more. Expecting a pleasant crowd, he was instead greeted with a raging mob calling for his head, and his convoy was quickly overwhelmed.

And today, it seems that one of them made his move.\n\nIn a meeting with his high command, Dirlewanger confidentially told them that he was considering none of them to be his successor. Rather, he would disband the brigade entirely when he felt he was old and wealthy enough to safely retire. Clearly, this did not sit well with his subordinates, as one of them proceeded to pull out a knife and stab Dirlewanger in the stomach. As they watched their former commander gasp his final breaths on the blood-soaked floor of the command tent, they all agreed that the truth would have to be concealed from the enlisted men. A hasty cover story, one suggesting that a Lysenkoite scientist sneaked in and poisoned his brandy, was concocted and issued to the men.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the lieutenants did not have a change in heart, and the backstabbing and intrigue resumed before Dirlewanger's body was even cold.

Unbeknownst to Oskar's brigade, as the small convoy vanished into the Siberian wilderness, it would be the last time that their leader would be seen alive. Almost a month later, they had not returned to camp. With infighting threatening to tear the group apart, a reconnaissance group was begrudgingly dispatched to retrieve information on the Bandit King's status. After a week of harsh travel, the recon mission came across a befuddling sight in an area known by natives as 'Dead Mountain'.\n\nWhat had appeared to be the remnants of the band's camp was buried halfway in snow. The large tent had a sizable hole on one of its walls, seemingly cut open with a knife. As the group followed a trail of light footprints down the hill to the edge of a nearby forest, they saw the corpses of two men, huddled around a nearby fire. Their bodies were coated in ice and nearly as pale as the snow they lied on. As they continued into the woods, they found a dark object sticking out of a nearby snowbank.

With an alarming lurch, the ground gave way under his vehicle's wheels, and chunks of ice began breaking up beneath him.\n\nTo his credit, the Black Bandit managed to smash his way free of the truck's cab, and swim upwards towards the light above. But nothing could save him from the shroud of ice that lay above, trapping him in the freezing depths. Clawing at the lake's frozen covering while his truck sank to the bottom behind him, Dirlewanger finally fell, not to battle, but to asphyxiation."

One soldier pulled out an exquisite and rare violin that he had stolen and said that he knew how to play. He started playing a traditional German folk tune, and all the German soldiers laughed and stood up and started to dance. After a while even the Russians and Ukrainians joined in, and to the shock of everyone Dirlewanger himself jumped up and started to move when the tune sped up.\n\nThe group danced for a few minutes, and even Dirlewanger was giggling with glee. He jumped and trotted and waltzed and did whatever dances vaguely came to mind, when suddenly his left foot hit a puddle of oil. He slipped terribly and his skull smacked the ground with a sickening crack not unlike two pool balls hitting each other. The violin immediately stopped and his soldiers gathered around him to see if he was okay. He very clearly was not, and after a bit of poking and prodding it became clear he was dead. The dance quickly turned into a panic as the revelers tried to figure out what to do next."

Smashing his way inside with a rifle butt, the first thing he saw was a man with dead, blinded eyes looking his way.\n\nThe blind man reached a hand out to stop him - and the Black Bandit shot him dead without a second thought.\n\nAfter frisking the body for any valuables, and propping the corpse up against a wall, Dirlewanger scoured the rest of the house for things to loot. There was nothing for him except a single small safe embedded in the wall.\n\nShooting the lock bought him easy access to the contents, and like a child opening a gift, he withdrew...papers. The safe contained nothing but old documents inscribed with the markings of the Soviet Union. A stack of photos was clipped to the top, a photo of what seemed to be the blind man standing atop a mountain and waving, with more mountains behind him. The classic scape of the Urals unfolded in the photograph, of exceptional quality.\n\nDirlewanger laughed, and threw it aside, into a pool of blood.\n\nThis was, by the sights of his band, the last thing that he ever did.

They came back with stories so unbelievable they could only be true, of weapons and gold and food in a secret Soviet military cache. So Dirlewanger had picked a handful of his most trusted lieutenants and left the next dawn, visions of gold and lead and fire bursting in the space behind his eyes. It was clear that whatever motivated him wasn't even entirely rational, if indeed his rationality had ever been there.\n\nThe journey had been arduous even on his veterans; a creeping fever or a madness had claimed most of the team, many slipping into the night screaming of "accursed visions", demoniac appearances. But Dirlewanger only saw power shining in the day and night skies, a new drug pulsing in his decaying bloodstream. It didn't matter how long he took - and now he thought about it, hadn't it been forty days since he'd set out? No matter. He would find it. He would.\n\nThe hill came to him as in a vision; weak with hunger and thirst, he fell alone on that barren hillside and screamed out the primal noises of victory. His team had all fallen away, but he was here - he was here! Everything was impossibly bright. Contours shifted. A blurred figure, leading him on to the edge of a cliff. He saw his petty kingdom, forged at gunpoint and held together by terror and pain. Sounds like words, faint but unmistakable. 'You bought the world and broke your soul, Oskar.

As they were on the outskirts of the brigade's camp, Dirlewanger made the decision to evacuate with a couple dozen of his closest men and hide out in the Ural foothills, leaving the majority of their loot behind.\n\nDespite their increasingly dire circumstances, having to constantly flee from the ever-approaching Ural Guard, and sparse supplies, Dirlewanger told his men to keep faith and stay loyal. He had a plan, he promised, to recover their ill-gotten earnings, enact their revenge on the Ural Guard, and flee west to salvation in Moskowien. However, this plan was constantly shifting and nebulous; one day it involved sparking a civil war in Magnitogorsk, raiding gold supplies in Orenburg the next, and breaking comrades out of Ural Guard prisons the day after. To his rapidly dwindling number of followers, it seemed that Dirlewanger was becoming delusional, or simply saying whatever his men wanted to hear in order to stay alive.\n\nUnsurprisingly, they eventually had enough. One of his men chose to rat him out, leaking the location of his latest hideout to a Ural Guard scout. As the Guards approached, the men scattered into the night, leaving Dirlewanger to fend for himself.

He swayed back and forth on the back of a half-scavenged Kettenkrad, out of his mind with bliss, and his men prowled the streets of the town, howling with laughter and drunkenness. They slipped into homes, in the pairs and quadruples, and soon the homes were alive with terrible noise, or silent.\n\nIn the second story of the building once known as a library, a hundred yards off, the sniper cleaned his rifle with a methodical ease. His name would be lost to time, but his deeds would not. He scrubbed the scope one last time, hefted the rifle onto the window-ledge, and aimed. NKVD agents 547b and 547a took their pistols to hand and began walking towards the main street. Their purpose had been made clear in the briefings. Failure was to be followed by termination. There would be only one window of opportunity for the action to be carried out. They reached the square, saw the figure dancing on the Kettenkrad, aimed. A lone gunman who had drifted down the swirl of dust and blood that was Western Russia had also turned up; radicalized by communism, he would be the one the Brigade punished with terrible fury in the final hours before it fell apart. He reached the horrified, staring crowds, pulled out a ludicrously long-barreled pistol, fired from the hip.\n\nThe bullets reached Oskar Dirlewanger and his team in 4.53 seconds, puncturing them in 15 separate places at different angles and rebounding.

However, it was not a debilitating issue, and it could not impede him from continuing to lead his men. But as time passed, Oskar Dirlewanger's situation continued to worsen. His back pain increased, going from a mild ache to a sharp, stabbing pain every time he walked or bent over. Formerly simple tasks, like riding a horse or firing a rifle, became unbearable tortures. Every time he tried, he felt a pain that he compared to someone holding his back over a bonfire.\n\nDirlewanger soon found himself bedridden, unable to even sit upright without subjecting himself to excruciating pain. He tried his best to continue running the Brigade, despite his camp doctors encouraging him to rest and avoid exerting himself too hard. Frankly, that was the only advice they could give, since they had no clue what could be causing this mysterious illness-was it a herniated disk? A pinched nerve? Some form of polio? They had no idea.\n\nFinally, Oskar Dirlewanger died one morning in his bed, howling with pain. Alcohol and morphine only provided brief respites from the suffering, and not even they could dull the pain he faced at the very end. When his cries finally stopped and he fell limp, the men of the Brigade silently felt relief that their overlord's suffering was over.

Inspired to take another satanic feat of his name, Dirlewanger placed a bet to his fellow bandits to steal these famed artifacts and burn down the whole village, putting an end to this silly and childish legend. As the village was closely protected by a humongous mountainous barrier, Dirlewanger realized that the easiest route to it was lying across the river and assembled a few boats for his last adventure. In his hubris, however, Dirlewanger greatly overestimated the capabilities of his boat he was sitting on. After crossing half the river, his boat couldn't handle the pressure of a sitting crowd and thick bags with equipment. Crackling under such unbearable weight, the boat eventually broke down into tiny pieces, leaving Dirlewanger and his closest men to drown in the frozen river. As Dirlewanger quickly died from a heart attack after the shock from the cold water, his men on other boats could only watch the humiliating death of their leader, while planning to take his place as soon as they reach the shores.\n\nWith the Bandit King's death, the village population can now sleep calmly without fear to be attacked by the marauders, as Dirlewanger's men turned on each other as soon as they reached the land, leaving themselves incapable to launch a raid without their heads being raised on pitchforks by furious villagers, a fate which followed those unfortunate souls who didn't try to escape with captured loot of their former combatants."

His drinking was coupled with his gorging on fresh chicken and bread that was perfectly created by Lysenko's chefs. He stuffed himself so much in his drunken glee, that he inevitably started choking.
