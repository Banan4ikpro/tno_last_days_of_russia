Although there are many ways to increase security, very few are absolute, and absolute security is necessary when the stakes are so high.\n\nWe will therefore sequester our entire nuclear program - laboratories, enrichment facilities, reactors, and production lines - in closed cities. These cities will not permit entry or exit to anyone without direct authorization from the highest levels of government.\n\nAlthough cumbersome and expensive, such is irrelevant. We must have safety and security for the program, and we will."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_a_foundation_for_research_desc:0 "More than twenty years of civil war has, among many other things, all but destroyed the educational infrastructure of the nation, and led to the emigration or death of most competent scientists and physicists.\n\nIf we are to have any hope of continuing and completing our nuclear program, we must address this. We cannot wait for skilled scientists to make themselves known or return from afar, or for advanced institutes to be reclaimed.

Just east of the Urals, near the city of Kurgan, surveyors are claiming to have found a massive deposit of uranium ready for exploitation.\n\nIn order to secure the deposit, an entire mining operation, and the infrastructure surrounding it, will have to be built from scratch. The effort required will be enormous, and the cost even greater, but such is irrelevant - we must have that uranium!"

 RUS_RWS_nukes_source_foreign_materials_desc:0 ""If we cannot find enough uranium to support our program domestically, we shall have to look farther afield. Agents, legal and otherwise, will be dispatched across the world to research and investigate both known and rumored uranium deposits.\n\nWhether we must buy the material, trade for it, or steal it, we will acquire it. The program must continue, and a bomb cares little for where the material inside it comes from."

 RUS_RWS_nukes_chasing_the_sun_desc:0 "Although it will be a long time before we have an operational nuclear weapon, we have successfully built the infrastructure necessary to ensure that we eventually will.\n\nOur laboratories and research facilities are constructed and secured. Our educational institutions are turning out scientists with the necessary skills. Our agencies have secured both domestic and foreign sources of fissile material. All that is left is time.\n\nWhen that day comes, and we complete our first nuclear test, we can take pride both in our accomplishments, and in the knowledge that Russia will, at long, long last, be free of outside interference."

 POLITICS_NO_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, no successor or splinter states have emerged in the most isolated peripheries of Siberia. Without any centralized bureaucracy, infrastructure, industry, large-scale trade, or long-distance communication to unite the region, the villages have largely reverted to the lifestyle they have held for centuries: subsistence farming, hunting, and animal herding. The local Yakut, Eveny, and Chukchi peoples have returned to practicing their shamanistic beliefs free of interference, and the Orthodox Russian villages do not bother to trouble them. The furthest anyone usually goes is over to the next village over, and residents may go many years before hearing a single scrap of news from the outside world.\n\nWhile the region may be rich in resources, the warlords in more habitable climes to the south and west see no point in conquering them. The size of the region, the lack of roads, and the harshness of the winters are enough to deter any sensible despot from attempting such a foolish action. And there is little danger in simply ignoring them - the closest most of the villages have to an army is a few old men armed with even older hunting rifles. It seems that unless the people of Siberia are able to somehow unify themselves or are conquered by a successful claimant to Russia's legacy, they will continue to eke out an existence as they always have: isolated and alone, on the edge of the world."

The enterprise was reorganized and reconstructed by prosperous gunsmith Mikhail Kalashnikov for the West Russian Revolutionary Front during its revanché against Germany, but the advance of the Tsarist cohort under Emperor Vladimir III forced the factory personnel to flee to Siberia, leaving the mechanical plant at the disposal of the Imperial Crown.\n\nDespite the damage it endured through the years of constant conflicts of West Russia, the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant remains one of the biggest arms manufacturing facilities in the Russian lands and provides superiority in firearms to any petty king in Russia who owns it."

 #Raiding
 raiding.100.t:0 "An Ultimatum"
 raiding.100.d:0 "We have received an ultimatum from [FROM.GetName], they are demanding that we hand over a tribute of loot, or else they will raid us and take it from us anyways.\n\nWe are at an impasse to decide, do we decide to engage in confrontation with [FROM.GetName], possibly risking our men dying at the hands of our enemies, or do we instead stand down and cave in to their demands, giving them the desired loot, allowing our men to live to fight another day?"
 raiding.100.a:0 "We will not back down so easily!"
 raiding.100.b:0 "Perhaps it is best we stand down and pay them the desired tribute."

 raiding.101.t:0 "They Refuse Tribute"
 raiding.101.d:0 "As is expected, [FROM.GetName] has told us that they reject our offer and are ready for battle, we must ready our men to prepare for the fight.\n\nAlas, bloodshed is sometimes unavoidable and we must prepare for what is to come, if they aren't going to cooperate, it is time we take the loot from [FROM.GetName] by force."
 raiding.101.a:0 "The sounds of gunfire continue to resonate in Russia."

 raiding.102.t:0 "Tribute Paid"
 raiding.102.d:0 "Miraculously, [FROM.GetName] has caved in and paid us tribute, handing over our desired loot from their state. Bloodshed has been avoided and our men live to fight another day, it is unlikely that [FROM.GetName] is to surrender to us so easily again."
 raiding.102.a:0 "Threats are sometimes needed to survive in the anarchy of Russia."

 raiding.1.t:0 "Raid Successful"
 raiding.1.d:0 "Our reports have returned; our men hurry home with trucks filled with loot and blood smeared over their hands. They congratulate each other for the successful raid against the unsuspecting enemy, patting their comrades on the back and taking the last few shots at the survivors scurrying away. We proclaim victory in this skirmish, as our men cheer and whistle in the hysteria of war, eager to present to us the treasures they have prized from the grips of our adversaries."
 raiding.1.a:0 "Seize all that we can use."
 
 raiding.2.t:0 "Raid Canceled"
 raiding.2.d:0 "We have no choice but to cancel the raid. Our raiding party rabble and rave, unable to communicate and work as a unit. They constantly jam their guns, and feud over scraps of ammunition they steal from each other. To send these clueless regulars out would be ridiculous - suicidal, even. Our time is best spent arming and training these men with the few resources we can gather so our next raid will not end in a total disgrace."
 raiding.2.a:0 "We were just not prepared..."
 
 raiding.3.t:0 "The Raid Fails"
 raiding.3.d:0 "Our men rush back from the frontier, wounded and bloody. Some dash with bandages wrapped around their battered heads; others lay motionless on the back of moving vehicles groaning and beckoning for help. The raid against our neighbors was an ambush, and they repelled our men with deadly force. Some of our dead are wagoned back with gashed flesh, exploded skulls, or chewed up by machine gun fire. We need more time to recover and recuperate, and perhaps with enough resources we can strike again."
 raiding.3.a:0 "We'll get the bastards next time!"
 
 raiding.4.t:0 "We have been raided!"
 raiding.4.d:0 "Our reports have come back from the frontiers, and it's terrible news. Bandits have ambushed our garrisons and massacred our men, leaving them as grotesque and gnarled corpses scattered across the plains. Moreover, we have been informed that they have infiltrated border towns and villages, plundering and looting all they could from the defenseless population. With our units unprepared, there is little we can do as they scurry back to where they came from, having left a path of utter misery and rampage behind them."
 raiding.4.a:0 "Dear God!"
 
 raiding.5.t:0 "The Enemy Falters"
 raiding.5.d:0 "With our recent preparation of defense procedures across the frontiers, the bandits from across the border scurry back into the shadows. No longer do they froth at the mouth and hunger for our bounties as they fear our potential for violent conflict over these contested territories. Clearly, expert defense and mind games have won the battle before a single drop of blood needed to be shed, as the enemy cowers before the skill and might of [Root.GetName]."
 raiding.5.a:0 "Hah! Look at the cowards run!"
 
 raiding.6.t:0 "The Enemy is Defeated"
 raiding.6.d:0 "Recent reports have been sent in of an overwhelming victory against a recent party of raiding bandits. In a brutal standoff, they were decimated by our valiant defense forces, and now their bodies lie scattered and mutilated by war. With survivors dashing for cover and retreating into the misty frontiers, our soldiers chant songs of victory and heroism in the face of invading evil. The rush of bloody defeat will certainly teach them a lesson about attacking the lands of [Root.GetName] for years to come!"
 raiding.6.a:0 "Now on to cleaning up the corpses..."
 
 raiding.7.t:0 "Relics of the Past"
 raiding.7.d:0 "Our recent raid on enemy territory has been a resounding success. After subduing the enemy forces on the battlefield, our brave soldiers have marched into several of the border towns and scrounged up treasures from the days of when Russia was united. Serving as a painful reminder of our own pitiful divisions, we have determined that some of these items can prove useful in developing our own fledgling industry. Indeed, we hope that they can aid in our return to the same position of power these commodities were fashioned in, and elevate these lands to a respectable and peaceful way of living once again."
 raiding.7.a:0 "But we must also think of the future..."
 
 raiding.8.t:0 "Food for the Hungry"
 raiding.8.d:0 "At long last, everyone finally has food for the night, and we need no longer work on empty bellies and broken hearts. Living off of half rations for months had taught us all temperance and composure, but gnawed at our minds in a silent and icy hysteria. Now, we have plenty of food for generations to come, and the people of [Root.GetName] can begin their toils without hunger bothering them throughout their maddeningly tiresome days."
 raiding.8.a:0 "Guess we're not going hungry tonight..."
 
 raiding.9.t:0 "The Spoils of War"
 raiding.9.d:0 "Victory! Our raiding parties drag home great bounties tied down to the roofs of military vehicles and lumped in sacks carried on horseback from enemy territories. With these treasures, we are able to fill our coffers, restock our armories, and increase production in our local industries. The balance of power has clearly shifted in our favor, and with each skirmish to come, we are better armed to tackle these challenges that encroach across the wild Russian frontiers."
 raiding.9.a:0 "This will help in the future."
 
 raiding.10.t:0 "Treasure!"
 raiding.10.d:0 "Our men have crushed the enemy, and uprooted from the land of everything of use to our raiding parties. In the chaos and hysteria of the violence, some of our men had smashed through the locks of a warehouse and stumbled across great treasures beyond our wildest dreams! Scrounging up the gold, precious metals, statues, and other remnants of Russia's past, dragging these relics home brings us immense wealth, prestige, and nostalgia for a great time. Perhaps this, even in the violence and brutality of these skirmishes, is a sign of great times to come for our people."
 raiding.10.a:0 "A Relic of the Past..."
 
 raiding.11.t:0 "Machines of the Past"
 raiding.11.d:0 "After crushing our foe, our men had charged into the enemy's warehouses and armories, snatching everything of use and destroying the rest that could not be carried. A group of our soldiers stumbled into a storage facility housing great industrial equipment. It would only be fitting to strap the machines to the back of our vehicles and haul them to our factories, where they can be appropriated and integrated into our production lines. Perhaps one day, with one machine at a time, we can rebuild Russia from the ground and restore her to her former glory."
 raiding.11.a:0 "With these maybe Russia will be rebuilt one day..."
 
 raiding.12.t:0 "Memories of the Past"
 raiding.12.d:0 "Our men rushed into the then desolate military bases of the enemy, surrounded by the bodies of the dead. Bursting through doors, yelling and wailing in a warlike-hysteria, and opening indiscriminate fire on any stragglers, our men flew down tight corridors and bombed-out rooms. They tore apart cabinets and storage units in search for supplies, arms, and equipment, until one detachment darted into a warehouse facility only to find relics of an old Russia. They put down their arms, and began scrounging to gather all the photos, video reels, and items they could. Receiving the goods this morning, we have found immense riches in the films, books, and paintings of a Russia before the anarchy - a beckoning reminder of our past glories and current shame."
 raiding.12.a:0 "With these maybe Russia will be united once more..."
 
 raiding.13.t:0 "Food Stolen"
 raiding.13.d:0 "This morning, we have found our food supplies emptied and looted by runaway bandits and criminals. At at least three locations, warehouses stockpiling grain, meats, salts, and tinned foods had been plundered, leaving nothing but a few spilled sacks of barley and ruined tins of meat. Children go to bed hungry at night, and farmers struggle to support our population. Something must be done, as it is only a number of weeks until our people will turn weapons on each other for something to eat."
 raiding.13.a:0 "Half-Rations this month it seems"
 
 raiding.14.t:0 "Garrison Slaughtered"
 raiding.14.d:0 "We awake today to news of death and defeat. Our barracks have been ravaged by bandit pillagers, and our garrison forces lay dead on the dirt in a particularly gruesome and horrific manner. With blood and brains splattered across walls and a glowing smoke leaving the soldier's quarters, our manpower has been seriously diminished by raiding forces in acts of sheer wickedness and brutality. Now, they are nowhere to be seen; the winds of the frontiers whistle and beckon, and the people of [Root.GetName] cower with fear. Whatever action is to be taken against these barbarian armies, it must be swift and it must be soon."
 raiding.14.a:0 "Bury the dead, and inform the families..."
 
 raiding.15.t:0 "Damaged Machinery"
 raiding.15.d:0 "After the latest raid in our territories, we can thankfully report that most of our civilian population has remained unharmed. However, the same cannot be said for our industrial production. With factory equipment plundered and multiple mills razed to the ground, our progress towards industrial development has been hampered significantly. Whilst we cannot improve our production as effectively at the moment, we can safeguard our people. Indeed, whilst machinery can be lost and retrieved - lives cannot."
 raiding.15.a:0 "Bastards!"
 
 raiding.16.t:0 "Looted Armouries"
 raiding.16.d:0 "Our generals have reported to us that a handful of armories under our control have been looted by raiding bandits. Rifles and ammunition have been reported missing; some armories having all of their contents emptied and stolen by raiding parties disappearing overnight. Assuming that these raiders have now long scurried past the frontiers by now, we find with our warehouses barren, we have less and less arms to defend ourselves from their prying hands. Action must be taken, lest we are soon robbed of our lives."
 raiding.16.a:0 "This will only encourage them..."
 
 raiding.17.t:0 "Villages Destroyed"
 raiding.17.d:0 "We have received reports today from the smouldering villages on our borders with neighboring territories. Our people have been slaughtered and our industries have been destroyed; raiding bandits must've crossed the frontiers with enough might and savagery to decimate our defences and leave our people bludgeoned and beaten. Hundreds lay dead on the ground in homes, town halls, and workplaces, and survivors shudder when talking of the raids. Stripped of much of our ability to effectively defend against bandit onslaught, we have been dealt a striking blow to our ability to govern these disputed territories. This is one of our weakest moments, and we must do all we can to survive and recuperate before we inevitably strike back with a burning fury."
 raiding.17.a:0 "What kinds of animals would do this..."

 #West Russian Wonders
 RUSwonder.0.t:0 "An End to Wonders"
 RUSwonder.0.desc:0 "We have come far! Where once our government was seen as a mere warlord, holding onto a scrap of Russian land, we can now assert ourselves as a proper nation on the world stage. Having made it into the final basket of candidates to reunify Russia, our country can stand proud of its accomplishment, and look to the road ahead with determination.\n\nThis progress has filled our citizens with awe, even as we rebuild the country, its infrastructures and its industries. However, our successes have rendered the Wonders of old much less critical to our efforts. Where once holding on to these relics of a happier past gave our government legitimacy and gave our people tools needed for survival, the Wonders under our control are now a tiny portion of our overall assets. They will no doubt continue to inspire our people, and they stand as mementos to the warlord era; but the age where holding onto Wonders was of great importance has come to an end."
 RUSwonder.0.a:0 "Onto an uncertain future."

 RUSwonder.1.t:0 "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Captured!"
 RUSwonder.1.desc:0 "We have acquired the Gorky tank factory, the largest producer of armored vehicles in West Russia. This factory was a vital part of Soviet industrial production and saw heavy usage during the West Russian War. In the aftermath of the WRRF's collapse, it fell into the hands of Nikolai Averin and his divisions of bandits, who used the factory to pump out tanks for their raids on Reichskommissariat Moskowien. An ignoble fate, for such an important piece of military infrastructure! Tanks are rare among the warlords of Russia, making anyone who can produce them a force to reckon with and making the factory a highly sought after prize.\n\nNow that it belongs to us, we can utilize Gorki's tank factory for a higher purpose than stealing scraps from the Germans. Regaining the capacity to produce tanks will be another step towards achieving the military capabilities of a full-fledged nation, and another step towards declaring a final victory in West Russia."
 RUSwonder.1.a:0 "The power of modern warfare, unleashed."

 RUSwonder.2.t:0 "Syktyvkar Arsenal Captured!"
 RUSwonder.2.desc:0 "We have secured the arsenal in Syktyvkar, a major stockpile of military weaponry that could prove decisive in securing victory in West Russia. Previously in the hands of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, it came into the possession of the fledgeling Komi Republic when the WRRF fled Syktyvkar. Komi used the arsenal to maintain order inside of its notoriously unstable capital and establish itself as a regional power, but, even with full access to it, was unable to prevent its loss. The arsenal contains firearms, explosives, tanks, and chemical weaponry, a fearsome collection for any would-be conqueror.\n\nHaving taken it, we are at a hefty advantage, proudly wielding the weapons that will bring us victory in West Russia. In the perpetual resource shortage of the post-Soviet order, every gun counts. Our control over the arsenal will afford us all the equipment we need to impose our authority over the region."
 RUSwonder.2.a:0 "Locked and loaded."

 RUSwonder.3.t:0 "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.3.desc:0 "After conquering the city of Izhevsk, we have secured our control over the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, the single greatest center of arms production in West Russia. Izhevsk has long been used to pump out enormous quantities of pistols, rifles, and other small arms. After the collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, Izhevsk and its factory became the property of Vladimir Romanov, the purported successor to Russia's late Tsar, who used it to build up his reactionary forces in a play for regional domination.\n\nNow that the plant is solidly ours, we can use it for the same purpose. In the Great Patriotic War and West Russian War, it was one of the primary producers of weapons for a huge number of soldiers. We can ensure that our armies are armed with new, modern firearms while our opponents struggle to assemble outdated arsenals."
 RUSwonder.3.a:0 "Drown them in a wave of lead."

 RUSwonder.4.t:0 "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Lost!"
 RUSwonder.4.desc:0 "We fought long and hard, but we have lost control of the Gorky tank factory, a major blow to our vehicle production capacity. The tank factory, formerly used to great effect by the West Russian Revolutionary Front against the Germans, has long been a strategic lynchpin in the region, since it is one of the only industrial centers capable of creating heavy armor. Tanks are disproportionately powerful against the relatively lightly armed armies that make up most of West Russia's military forces; any warlord with them in possession can expect to be taken very seriously.\n\nThe factory gave us an undeniable edge in firepower, and will likely be used for very similar purposes by its new owners. We are far from doomed, but we should expect a larger quantity of tanks and armored vehicles in the near future and prepare accordingly."
 RUSwonder.4.a:0 "A troubling development."

 RUSwonder.5.t:0 "Syktyvkar Arsenal Lost!"
 RUSwonder.5.desc:0 "Our soldiers defended it in running street battles throughout Syktyvkar, but the massive arsenal stored in that city is no longer ours. Belonging initially to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the arsenal was abandoned when the Red Army fled the city in the late 1950's and used by the Komi Republic to maintain order and equip its military. It includes a great quantity of firearms, ammunition, grenades, and, perhaps most interestingly to the less discerning warlord, chemical weapons.\n\nWe have much to fear now that the arsenal has left our control. We have naturally acted according to the laws of warfare, but that same guarantee cannot be said of our opponents; it is entirely possible that the arsenal's new stewards will employ chemical weapons against us. This, combined with the new deficit in weapon quantity caused by the turnover, means that the balance of power in West Russia has shifted by a noticeable amount."
 RUSwonder.5.a:0 "We are outgunned, but not yet outmatched."

 RUSwonder.6.t:0 "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.6.desc:0 "With the loss of the city of Izhevsk, and the mighty Izhevsk Mechanical Plant with it, we may be in dire straits. The plant, the largest small arms factory in West Russia, is a prize coveted by any warlord worth his salt. Its usage dates back to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the only force in living memory able to produce weapons on a quantity capable of challenging Germany. The plant went from their control to ours, and now lies in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNothing is certain in the chaotic battlefields of West Russia, but we can surmise that this has been a significant loss to our forces. Although we will not feel the loss immediately, the decrease in our productive capacity is sure to have negative effects on our ability to equip our troops in the future. Shortages are likely, and modern production techniques will once again become a luxury for our forces. We are far from finished, but this is a concerning development nevertheless."
 RUSwonder.6.a:0 "We will make up for their guns with our mettle."
 
 RUSwonder.7.t:0 "Vorkuta Gulags Caputured!"
 RUSwonder.7.desc:0 "As our men sweep over the arctic plains, the infamously dreadful Vorkuta Gulags have come under our administration. The dark complex of watch-towers, gloomy barracks, and labor camps strike a trembling fear in these icy wastes; the unbelievable torture of this natural prison serves as a reminder of the wickedness of men. The enemy's men lay scattered across the courtyard, buried in debris and torn to pieces by machine gun fire. With blood freshly painted on dark brick walls, the smell of gunpowder was thick and the silence after battle was deafening.\n\nWe were in a place of immense suffering, and whilst many of our men broke down doors to scurry in and rummage for loot, others lowered their weapons to gaze at the daunting site that dwarved them. With the Gulags largely preserved from war, however, this does pose a question: are we to close the site down forever and let it remain a relic of our barbarous past, or must we plunge our hands in the dirty realities of this war so that Russia may live on?"
 RUSwonder.7.a:0 "Sometimes, great men do awful things."
 RUSwonder.7.b:0 "Never again, not like this."
 
 RUSwonder.8.t:0 "Ural Automotive Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.8.desc:0 "With Chelyabinsk now conquered, our men sweep through the city in search of anything of value in the ongoing conflict with our neighbors. Raiding teams zip across streets, firing at the remnants of enemy divisions holding out in homes and buildings scattered across the urban sprawl, and crackles of gunfire echo throughout the streets from skirmishes a few blocks away. A unit of our men had besieged an encampment holding out in the Ural Automotive Plant, and upon breaching enemy defenses, the Plant was pried from the few dozen men left clinging to their lives.\n\nWith this major manufacturing site under our control, our soldiers will now have greater access to off-road vehicles in later confrontations. This has great potential to improve our supply lines, and aid in improving the speed of our reinforcements. The powerful engines produced in the Ural Automotive Plant are renowned for their speed and dexterity over difficult terrain, and will definitely prove useful in our navigational and incursive efforts across the Russian anarchy. Truly, with the aid of the motor, this is a victory for our people and the future of Russia."
 RUSwonder.8.a:0 "Onwards, countrymen!"
 
 RUSwonder.9.t:0 "Zlatoust Arms Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.9.desc:0 "Our defeat in the plains of Southern Russia have cost us our control over the Zlatoust Arms Plant, a mighty and monumental tool in the wars against our bandit neighbors. The factory that had reliably constructed and manufactured arms for our men now sits under the control of our adversaries, and if we give them enough time before it is taken back they will begin to use the great instrument of war against us. Surviving the German invasion and much of the Russian anarchy, the plant is a symbol of warring resilience in the face of brutal conflict, and it is now pointed against us.\n\nLand dispute and skirmishes plague this side of Russia, and there is no telling of our fate in future conflicts without the factory. However, what is known is that this is a noteworthy defeat, and perhaps the beginning of our end. Our decrease in materiel production will inevitably lead to shortages down the line, and with our forces used to modern production technology, this could spell our undoing. Death does not approach today, and it may not tomorrow, but with less and less weapons to defend ourselves we must be cautious of a time where we are unarmed and alone in the brutality of this war."
 RUSwonder.9.a:0 "Count your bullets and keep a hold of your gun."
 
 RUSwonder.10.t:0 "Vorkuta Gulags Lost!"
 RUSwonder.10.desc:0 "In our defeats across Northern Russia, the frontlines have pushed us out of the Vorkuta Gulag system and have effectively conceded the complex to the enemy. As we did retreat from the area, prisoners grew ever more feral and hysterical as they witnessed our defeat. The wild frenzy of conflict punished our men, and perhaps to the prisoners it was some kind of sick justice.\n\nWhilst we do have the opportunity to strike back, our men are tired and shaken by the evictions of war. The bitter chill of the arctic winds do not accommodate for the spirits of the defeated, and as honorable as our troops can be, the numbing cold could bring them no respite. We march to regroup in the frontiers of our territories, but with the wild panic of the gulags burned into the memories of our men, their courage for battle seems irrecoverable and may spell our coming defeat. "
 RUSwonder.10.a:0 "Someone will be shot for this!"
 
 RUSwonder.11.t:0 "Ural Automotive Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.11.desc:0 "Our men have fought valiantly in the city of Chelyabinsk, skirmishing with the enemy and braving the metal shred of gunfire, but their sacrifices were not enough to defend the Ural Automotive Plant from the advances of the enemy. The factory's machines continued to crash and clunk in the haze and chaos of war, exchanging hands as the frontlines danced from street to street.\n\nWe retreat away from the city to encampments in the surrounding wilderness, plotting our recapturing of the factory. However, until then, we are to expect that our adversaries will make use of their new toys to produce the same vehicles that had aided us in our battles in the past. Whilst this is not a dishonourable defeat, it is a defeat nonetheless, and one that could spell our doom as the enemy grows stronger with every engine produced."
 RUSwonder.11.a:0 "A great loss for us."
 
 RUSwonder.12.t:0 "Zlatoust Arms Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.12.desc:0 "The Zlatoust Arms Plant burns bright in the distance as our men retreat into the wilderness to regroup, and explosions of ammunition caches are audible from the frontiers of the battlefield. Defeat looms over the troops as they gaze at the crumbling fortress they had fought for days in to defend. Overcome with a wicked cynicism, many turned away and continued their march, bitter and defeated by the enemy.\n\nThe arms plant, whilst not completely destroyed, has come under enemy control and will most certainly be exploited to produce thousands of arms in the coming weeks. Although our men did gather all they could to carry with us away from the battlefield, it remains an unspoken truth as of now that we will begin to experience tight weapon shortages as the enemy approaches further towards our encampments outside of the city."
 RUSwonder.12.a:0 "We have certainly lost an advantage today."
 
 RUSwonder.13.t:0 "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Captured!"
 RUSwonder.13.desc:0 "Crashing through the forested mountains surrounding the city, our men have overrun the city of Krasnoyarsk, and with it we have taken the widely-discussed Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction. The tall and mighty station building stretched across the urban space and dominated our soldiers' view; it was a logistical fortress, stuffed with bulky metal trains resting on the platforms.\n\nWith a crucial junction of the Trans-Siberian railway now under our control, we can now more vastly improve our logistical abilities in performing the Herculean task of re-uniting Russia. Piling heaps of ammunition caches and supply crates onto the trains, we can deliver these resources to our frontlines far more effectively, as well as increase the speed in which communications can be delivered. Our grasp over the Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction will stretch our influence across Siberia, and is a step towards extending our power to reunite Russia under our watch."
 RUSwonder.13.a:0 "A boon to be sure!"
 
 RUSwonder.14.t:0 "Kuznetsk Basin Captured!"
 RUSwonder.14.desc:0 "Our men spill over the ruins of the Kuznetsk Basin, battling through the remains of enemy fortifications and pockets of wounded squadrons. With gunfire still crackling in the distance, the embers of burning structures clawed at the sky with roaring flames. Wind rushed through the Kuznetsk Depression, carrying with it the blackened stench of the coal reserves now under our control.\n\nWith such rich natural resources now under our administration, we have access to generate immense amounts of energy. The power produced by excavated coal reserves can promptly increase our manufacturing capabilities, as well as provide energy to the many citizens living within our territory. A highly valuable and sought-after location in Central Siberia, this prized asset under our jurisdiction must be put to use soon so we may reap the benefits of the coal mines before any of our enemies manage to snatch it from us themselves."
 RUSwonder.14.a:0 "We have won a great victory today!"
 
 RUSwonder.15.t:0 "Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.15.desc:0 "The recent fall of Novosibirsk and the retreat of enemy forces across the frontiers of the battlefield has left us in control of the now idle Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. Towering and dormant, the factory was constructed before the Great Patriotic War and has manufactured vehicles capable of flight for her administrators ever since.\n\nNow with the plant under our control, we will soon have access to a fresh arsenal of aircraft fit for any purpose for our armies. Motor engines roar, and squadrons of planes may fly in the Siberian skies bearing our insignia. To first dominate the plains and wastes of Central Siberia by land, we must tame the wild airs of our broken Russia. With this plant, this future may be ours for centuries to come."
 RUSwonder.15.a:0 "To the skies!"
 
 RUSwonder.16.t:0 "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Lost!"
 RUSwonder.16.desc:0 "Our men hurried into train cars as the enemy's siege was nearing its completion. The crackle of gunfire and boom of artillery shells had shaken our men to the core, but there was some sense of comfort knowing that the trains left the Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction in the nick of time to escape enemy skirmishes.\n\nHowever, although we have our men's lives, we no longer possess the administrative and logistical crown jewel that was the junction in Krasnoyarsk. The extension to communicate and ship resources from one end of our territory to the other was invaluable, but now in the hands of our adversaries. By sacrificing that key location, we had given up our great stretch over Central Siberia and potentially our future in reuniting our shattered Russia."
 RUSwonder.16.a:0 "Curse our enemies!"
 
 RUSwonder.17.t:0 "Kuznetsk Basin Lost!"
 RUSwonder.17.desc:0 "Our men lay battered and bloody, their corpses sprawled across the Siberian frontiers. In the chaos of war and violence, our control over the Kuznetsk Basin was lost and with it goes our access to the immense amounts of coal deep in the ore-rich deposits.\n\nWith such a great power source taken from us, we are likely to experience shortages in production and problems with fuel conservation. We now are forced to turn to rely on finite resources of energy spread thin across our territories. If mismanaged, this could very well spell the end of our existence and chance to reunite Russia, dooming us to the anarchy our men have fought so tirelessly against."
 RUSwonder.17.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 RUSwonder.18.t:0 "Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.18.desc:0 "With our recent defeats in the Novosibirsk region, our recent reports have made it clear that the enemy now controls the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. With one of the largest aircraft manufacturers now in the enemy's hands, we have been dealt a swift and powerful blow that may lead us towards a humiliating defeat. The factory has been scathed by the tremors of war, but unfortunately our intelligence suggests that the plant may continue manufacturing operations.\n\nNow under enemy control, the factory may open a new front in the air against our men, and with our ability to replenish our planes at a continual rate now nullified, we face the terms of defeat on the battlefield from the air as well as from the front lines. It is only a matter of time before the skies belong to our adversaries, and our struggle towards victory will become ever more burdensome."
 RUSwonder.18.a:0 "A big loss for us."
 
 RUSwonder.19.t:0 "Port of Magadan Captured!"
 RUSwonder.19.desc:0 "As our troops rushed past the far eastern frontiers, their assault on enemy lands was halted only by the sea. The great Pacific, open and wide, had met our men after bloody battle as the Port of Magadan had come under our control. The icy and choppy waters stretched for miles in every direction in front of them; the mysterious stretch of Siberian waters was a home to by far the most significant port in the Eastern Russian wastes.\n\nA hub of trade and smuggling, with a particular taste for Japanese and American goods, the Port of Magadan opens up greater opportunities for our administration to not only trade wares, but also make a name for ourselves across the globe. Indeed, with this invaluable port under our control, we pray to see our foot in the door to international recognition and trade."
 RUSwonder.19.a:0 "The gateway to Russia has been secured"
 
 RUSwonder.20.t:0 "Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station Captured!"

Constructed under the orders of Genrikh Yagoda after the Soviet Union was pushed back to the corners of Siberia, this work of infrastructure has reliably generated energy for the entire city under his command. A mighty symbol of Russian mastery over nature, the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station may also be a symbol of our control over the Siberian frontiers amidst the chaos of warlordism in the East.\n\nGiven the immense amounts of electricity gathered from the currents of the river, we can utilise the potential of the Hydroelectric station to send power to our manufacturing plants, factories, and the homes of citizens living within our territory. The concrete station towered over the Siberian wastes and churned through great amounts of the Angara's water to generate electricity. We will utilise the natural veins of our fractured nation, and with such a magnificent source of electricity in the region our energy supplies will never run dry!"

With most of the airbase left intact after the siege, we find that the field may be able to be put into purpose sooner rather than later. The aircraft that sit in the hangars sulk, their metal wings still and unused.\n\nWith an entire airbase now under our control, our territories can now support the squadrons of planes tearing across the ashen Siberian skies. With the airfield as an asset in our favor, our men may advance through the Siberian wastes knowing full well that pilots watch over them from the skies.

Whilst battling the untamed wilderness of Siberia poses great threat to our men, our loss of the Port of Magadan will surely hit us even harder if we are not able to snatch it back from our adversaries.\n\nWith American and Japanese goods no longer accessible from the port, weeks remain before our administration and our men begin to starve from a lack of resources, food, and materiel. We must make the decision now to either tighten our belts and brace for impact, or we gather our forces and battle for the port once more.

Our soldiers watch from the distance as enemy troops and engineers tinker with the smoldering debris that surround the Hydroelectric station, consulting each other on the strategy required to take the facility back.

Moreover, with our retreat from the airbase, the enemy now has access to airfields and planes to support further aerial assaults against the advancement of our own forces.

Many people view Lenin as the father of a political movement which has, through its stupidity and incompetence, led to the collapse of our nation.

She had lost an ear to the shrapnel of the bomb that had destroyed the structure, and with only one remaining she was having difficulty determining exactly where sounds were coming from.\n\nScared and alone, she wanted nothing more than to once again hear the laughter and banter that had so often occupied both the structure and the firepit outside it. The laughter that would always follow a long day of hunting and tracking, when she would be congratulated by the hunters for expertly leading them through the dense brush.\n\nSasha waited there all day, confident that the hunters would, must, return. She had always been faithful to them, and could not fathom the idea that they would not show faith in return. Evening came, and she remained, curling as much as possible for warmth. Night fell, and she remained, watching the curious eyes of the many other predators inspect her from the treeline.\n\nWhen morning arrived on the second day, hunger came with it, and Sasha knew that her friends were not coming back. That there was no reason to stay here any longer, and she needed to hunt besides. But she had not forgotten her friends, and she knew that, wherever they were, they could not have forgotten her.\n\nSasha knew she had to go find them.

He had only been inducted into the Order a month before, and had not yet gotten used to the chill of dawn patrols.\n\nHearing a twig snap behind him, Vladimir whirled around, readying his rifle as he did so. Expecting a person, he was surprised to find a dog, missing one ear, and looking back at him with head cocked to one side. Letting out a nervous laugh, he re-shouldered his rifle and took a step forward.\n\n"Hello," he began, "you look lost. Are you lost?" The dog didn't make a sound or move to retreat as Vladimir knelt beside it and stroked its surprisingly coarse coat, feeling for a moment that rarest of emotions in the Russia: peace.\n\nAfter a short while the dog whined and pulled away, and Vladimir watched it until it disappeared beyond the horizon. He sat down on a stump, lit another cigarette, taking care to hold it tighter, and sighed.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, in a way everyone in Russia was a dog. Just as this dog had lost an ear, everyone in Russia be they raiders, civilians, workers, guards, or something else, had lost something. Russia was not a hospitable place. All that Russia offered to most of its people was hardship.\n\nBut maybe someday, like that dog, he and everyone else would find a simple kindness in their fellow man.

Hunger was building.\n\nLooking for a safe place to rest for a moment, Sasha found it under the arms of a pine tree. It was only once there that she realized she was not alone. Across from her she could see two men crouched over a deer trail.\n\n"We won't find anything to eat if this keeps up, you know," she heard one of them, an older man with a deep voice, say.\n\n"Shut up!" the other, younger one, replied. "I told you, I'm no tracker. I'm a farm-" He suddenly stopped speaking as he saw Sasha out of the corner of his eye and suddenly stood.\n\nShe met his eyes, and saw no malice in them. After a long moment, the young man reached into his pocket, withdrawing several strips of cured meat which he threw in front of her. Feeling her hunger, Sasha moved to devour them, before years of rigid training stopped her in her tracks.\n\n"Look at that, Pavel!" the older man said. "A trained dog!" He laughed as he approached her, the sound reminding her of better times. Caressing her neck, he directed her towards the trail, picking up and offering the jerky to her as he did. She quickly ate what was offered, and knew what to do next, sniffing the deer trail and looking in the direction of the smell.\n\n"See, Pavel!" the older man exclaimed. "A tracking dog. Lead on!"\n\nAt the command, Sasha cantered into the forest, the humans following behind. She might not have found her old friends, but she had at least found new ones.\n\nAnd that was enough to make her happy again."

And he was far too much of a coward to try for anything bigger - and potentially more dangerous.\n\nLowering the rifle in frustration, he heard a noise from one side, and turned to find a one-eared dog standing there, watching him quizzically. Quickly overcoming his sudden surprise, and realizing the opportunity, Sergei stood very slowly and began approaching it.\n\nHe moved the muzzle of the rifle closer to it with each step, but after only two such steps he realized his mistake. The dog knew well what the rifle met, and only a moment after their eyes met the dog quickly turned and began to run.\n\nSwearing, Sergei took a knee and fired a single shot, striking the dog in its hind leg. Bounding over to it, Sergei found it still alive, though unable to move. It whined at him as he knew what he had to do, raising the rifle and firing a second shot. Kneeling down beside it, he withdrew his knife and began butchering it.\n\nHe did not know how the dog had gotten there, what had happened to drive a clearly trained dog into the wilds, and in truth he did not care.\n\nWhatever else the dog had once been, it was now food."

An aging, stolid Bavarian launched into a blistering political tirade, spittle flying in the air, as Vasily nervously eyed the rifle mounted on the wall. "...your residence has been classified as Schedule I Expropriated Land Belonging to the Russian People." A quailing Dutch housewife asked what it all meant in the broken German her husband had taught her.\n\n"Accordingly, in thirty days legal ownership of your house and land will be transferred to its original, prewar owner..." A farmer pleadingly recounted all that he had built on the land, his watching children on the brink of tears in the background. "...and it is advised that you leave the property with all of your possessions by that time." An aging veteran said nothing, but gave Vasily a look of almost-sympathy, as if he somehow understood.\n\n"Please refrain from damaging the property. You will be charged for any damage you do the land prior to your departure." A sobbing construction worker was no longer listening. "The Russian state regrets that this action has to be taken, but believes it to be necessary in order to ensure the just compensation of those who lost property due to the German occupation. An elderly woman stared back at the newest ideologue on her doorstep with blank, almost lifeless eyes.\n\n"Do you have any questions?""

It is a new day for Russia, and begets the first time in over two decades that the scarred region seems to stand united in any real purpose, and behind any real cause.\n\nThe reaction from international onlookers to the cheering crowds is mixed, in Europe, many fear the Slavic revenge and the sudden possibility of retribution for their failures in the World War, while in America, many celebrate, leftists heralding this as the pendulum swinging back against the Nazis and Japan.\n\nIn Russia, however, the people are united. Even those who decry the Soviets and Communism can not deny the fact that a united Russia is the only hope the region has had in seemingly a lifetime, and already, many debate what, exactly, the nation shall do now."

Cheering crowds and marching soldiers can be seen in every major population center, with every village at least having one or two drunken militiamen waving the flag of this new union stumbling through its streets.\n\nIt is a new day for Russia, a new regime. The nation has experimented with monarchy, Communism and now, after its greatest defeat, ironically, fascism. Many look in surprise as the Russians seem to have adopted the same ideology as their most hated enemies, but at the same time many others see this as the natural reaction.\n\nTo fight your enemies, they say, you must become the enemy."

A new, modern, Russian Republic will replace the squabbling warlords, and bring unity and justice to the Russian people.\n\nNobody knows, exactly, what the Russians plan.

Russia's true downfall, after all, seemed to come once the Tsar was overthrown, and autocratic sentiments have survived long into the warlord era.\n\nSurprise or no, however, a Tsar now sits in charge of Russia in all of her vastness, and the people of the nation for the first time in decades have something, or more accurately, someone, to unite behind. While those in the west look at this with approval, Japan and Germany have both begun preparing their armies, fearing that a renewed conflict in Russia will be the breaking point for their empires.\n\nThe only reaction not known is that of the new Tsar, and many wait in fear or anticipation for their first decrees."

While many welcome an end to the cruelty and banditry that has been endemic to the nation's warlord era for long, behind a single autocratic military leader and his inner circle, Russia is now also a beast to be feared.

Economic aid flooded the region, new roads and rail lines were built for the first time in decades, new factories were opened, and the lives of those under the gaze of the Mountain knew a markedly better existence than that of before.\n\nOf course, with these economic incentives came political meddling. At first the influence was minor, a change of policy here and there, but now it was clear that the Black Mountain was shackled to their benefactors. More often than not, Andrei got his orders from men outside his chain of command. Even this patrol, as minor as it was, came down to outside influence.\n\nAs he walked past another shuttered house, Andrei could not help but be thankful. With things as they were, it would not have been long before he was liquidated for his doubts and regrets. Now, the simple mundanity of patrolling the Urals calmed him.\n\nAndrei finally looked to his partner, Alexei.

Even from so far away he could feel the man's nerves, something was going on and it was nothing good. He had heard all he needed of the Black Mountain to despise its rulers, but he also understood the necessity of taking control of the region --even if he would prefer to storm the Mountain and kill every NKVD bastard within.\n\nThe subject of the man's nerves quickly became apparent when the screaming started.

Not only because whatever the hell they're doing in there will continue, but because it makes a massive war extremely likely.\n\nNow, the sensible thing to do would be to back down. A war isn't good, especially one that we may lose. Taking our time, getting to full strength, and preparing for the war would be a better idea. A sudden action that is taken without thought could destroy all that we have built and strived for.\n\nThe moral thing to do would be to send our army to crush this maggot that crawled out of the corpse of the Soviet Union, and anyone who wants to defend the crimes they have committed.

Our rival still has their sights set on absorbing the nation into their borders, and now that we have threatened to use military force once, it seems likely that they will be more prepared if we should ever do it again. The people of Kazakhstan may not appreciate us appointing ourselves as their guardian either. They are on very good terms with our rival and many may have looked forward to their annexation. Our interdiction into their foreign affairs will not win us many supporters in the territory.

They say that the government of Nowa Polska is open to being integrated into their nation, and the matter is between them to settle. If we want to prevent the annexation it seems that we will have to back our threat of military intervention with action. Going to war would stop the annexation, but we may be entering into a conflict we are not fully prepared for. On the other hand failing to invade would humiliate us on the world stage. We would be known as a nation that makes empty threats and false promises. Complicating matters further is Nowa Polska itself. If the peaceful annexation fails our rival will likely try to invade to secure the steppe before we can, making the free territory a natural ally to our cause. However if Nowa Polska is allowed to stay neutral they might view us as the aggressors for intervening in their affairs and going to war to prevent them from integrating into our rival. This would make winning them over to our side even more difficult. The fate of Russia hangs by a thread and time is running out. We must make a decision now."

Our rival across the steppe has decided that annexing the steppes was not worth risking open military conflict with us, and they have cancelled their plans for integration. Nowa Polska will remain a sovereign beacon of independence and prosperity in Central Asia, at least for now. However, the diplomatic struggle over the fate of the territory is far from over. Our rival still has their sights set on absorbing the nation into their borders, and now that we have threatened to use military force once, it seems likely that they will be more prepared if we should ever do it again. The people of Nowa Polska may not appreciate us appointing ourselves as their guardian either. They are on very good terms with our rival and many may have looked forward to their annexation. Our interdiction into their foreign affairs will not win us many supporters in the territory. However, what is most important is that the steppes remain out of the hands of our rival, and for now at least that will remain the case. As long as Nowa Polska is free we have a chance to win them over to our cause, but we must act quickly."

They have betrayed us at our most dire hour, as their rival across the Urals prepares to force us to accept integration into their realm or fight. Our forces are massively outnumbered and outgunned making any attempt to fight for our survival tantamount to suicide, but perhaps death is preferable to surrendering the freedom we have worked so hard to achieve. The cowards to our north have tossed Orenburg to the wolves, and with our defender turning their back on us their rival will soon press their demands. We must decide what our response will be."

Rather than let us negotiate a settlement with Nowa Polska that would have peacefully integrated the city into our nation, they have plunged Russia into war yet again. Troops have already begun clashing along the entire length of the Eurasian continent. With the outbreak of hostilities Nowa Polska's diplomats have formally backed out of all unification talks, despite our diplomats making the consequences of ending negotiations clear. In response we have no choice but to invade the Polish state. We cannot risk allowing Nowa Polska to fall under the control of our rival. Now we have been thrust into the unenviable position of fighting both Nowa Polska and our rival at the same time. Our only remaining option is to crush them both quickly and decisively. We tried to do things peacefully, but it seems reuniting Russia requires yet more Russian blood be spilled. We can only hope this new struggle will be more civilized than those we have already fought."

Once they realized we would not be bullied into submission their bold posturing quickly collapsed. Our rival has proven to be unwilling to back big words with big actions, and the way is clear to take Nowa Polska peacefully or by force. Now that they know they will face us alone, the Polish state has one last chance to accept peaceful annexation. If they would rather perish than go quietly, we are more than happy to oblige them."

The Polish state will now be annexed into our nation and integration efforts can begin. Despite how many in Nowa Polska feel, there is no dishonor in this decision. By avoiding war they have spared the lives of thousands and the incalculable destruction another war would have brought to Central Asia.

Even after being abandoned by our rival and left to fend for themselves, the people of Nowa Polska still refuse to see reason. They have no chance against our superior numbers and firepower. Perhaps they believe their dedication to freedom will be enough to overcome us. They are incredibly mistaken, as we will soon show them. When it is all over they cannot say we didn't try to do things the nice way.

In recent days more and more units have arrived at our borders and are stationing themselves in what seem to be predetermined positions. At this point it seems certain that one of our neighbors has given up on diplomacy and is preparing to invade! We must mobilize the army of Nowa Polska and prepare the people for war.

This astonishing move has ended all hopes for a peaceful resolution to the disputes over the region, and our government and military are scrambling to prepare a response.\n\nOur diplomats are encouraging us to come to the defence of the local powers and declare war on our rival. They say we cannot afford to look weak by allowing the invasion to proceed uncontested and we shall win the undying loyalty of the people of Kazakhstan by coming to their rescue. Once the war is over and our rival has been defeated this will make it easier to persuade the local governments that they would be better off integrating into our state.\n\nOur generals agree that we cannot risk humiliation by sitting the crisis out, but they do not believe it is worth coming to the rescue of the Kazakh states, pointing to our own plans to annex the region sooner or later. Instead they advocate for our own intervention in response. With the armies of Kazakhstan already busy fighting our rival we would be free to sweep in and capture most or possibly even all of Kazakhstan. This would also allow us to continue our preparations for a possible future war against our rival.\n\nThe third option would be to avoid getting directly involved in the situation while we continue preparing for a war on our terms. This might make us appear weak and cowardly to our rival, and we would be handing over a large stretch of Russian territory essentially uncontested. However, there is no denying that we have been caught off guard and we must be careful not to act recklessly."

 ### Finland Diplo ###
 russiadiplo.37.t:0 "The Viipuri Conference"
 russiadiplo.37.desc:0 "In its short existence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Finland had rarely been inactive. Orbiting our former overlords in the east as we do, diplomacy has always had its place as the shield of our young nation. The Soviet war of aggression in the thirties had been feared, and diplomats had spent their entire careers trying to prepare for it. Now, the era of Russian unification has set a new crisis into motion.\n\nOnce merely one of many risible "government of national unity" , our opponent now stands on the border of our forward line in Onega. Every possible regional rival has been vanquished. Now this unifier has come for the last few pieces of Russian land in western Russia that is not directly shielded by the Germans. And they'll want it quickly, for our military analysts predict the rise of threatening rivals in Siberia and the Far East. The logic of unification demands that the government of western Russia plucks every low hanging fruit as quickly as possible.\n\nRather than use blunt force, this new western Russian state seeks to enter into talks with our government, and has proposed that a conference take place in Viipuri, Karelia. It is perhaps a mercy that this jumped up war band prefers diplomacy. But no amount of words can change the strategic situation that Finland stands alone, that our military buffer zone in Onega shields our population and industry from warfare, and that abandoning it without a fight might invite our future subjugation by Ivan. The Russian's bluster of a massive army crashing onto us does not change the fact that their army is equipped with scraps of decaying Soviet equipment, while ours is modern and well armed. This might be our best and only chance to delay or prevent the formation of a hostile government on our doorstep.\n\nIn the halls of the foreign ministry, there is constant dialogue. Hawks demand a general mobilization order. Doves beg the government to make use of this reprieve to open dialogue with the Russians and see what they desire. No matter our decision, the Russian ambassador waits wordlessly. He probably already knows what course of action we intend to choose."

The government of Finland isn't staffed by fools; the same reasons why our government desires Onega back are the reasons why they refuse to return it. Both of our nations desire to hold strategic ground that might prove essential in any future war between Russia and Germany, or between Russia and Finland. The Finnish generals remember the first winter war, where the Red Army eventually overran the Mannerheim line on the Karelian isthmus.\n\nA more bloodthirsty government than ours might have not bothered with diplomacy. If we cannot convince the Finns to see reason, then we can punish them for their perfidy. They have seen fit to enslave Russians for its protection, to hide in the shadow of the German hegemon. We will weep for the brave men of Onega, forced into servitude by cowardly Finns. But we shall shed no tears for Onega's backers in Helsinki."

Our ambassador informs us that Helsinki has agreed to a high level diplomatic conference between our two nations.\n\nIt is pleasing that the Finns have not done anything rash, and have agreed to at least give us some time to make demands. Some cynics in our government suspect Helsinki of merely stalling for time to order a full mobilization. The fact remains that war can be avoided. Before anything else, however, Helsinki wants to know our terms.\n\nOnega must be returned to us, its population freed from their janissary duty for Finland. That much is essential. This does not mean, however, that the Russo-Finnish frontier should remain a dagger pointed at Finland's heart. We could simply demilitarize Onega, and sign a nonaggression pact for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Finns would probably accept such a deal, and Helsinki would likely see it as too good to be true... Thus, a better deal would be the return of Onega in full, with our troops in the region. Eastern Karelia will be also be integrated to Russia as an autonomous region, with the Finns granted an open border into the region. This would return to us the arctic port of Murmansk. South-western Karelia and its critical city of Vyborg, or Viipuri in Finnish, would stay under Helsinki's control. Demilitarized zones and non-aggression treaties will follow, preventing any future war between our peoples.\n\nOf course, we could just demand it all. No matter how attached the Finns are to Vyborg and south-western Karelia, their paltry army cannot save them for long. Onega's ramshackle mob of conscripts will not slow us long, if they choose to fight their countrymen at all. The Finns will agree to our demands for Onega and all of Karelia, or pay for their arrogance."

The borders of our nations would be demilitarized, and a treaty of non-aggression would guarantee a return to peaceful relations. Additionally, the rest of Karelia will be given limited autonomy under a Finnish administration, with military access and open borders to both Finland and Russia.\n\nAbandoning Kola and Muurmanni is seen as a bridge too far by many in our nation. This is a great deal of land, and many of our citizens have moved there and call it home.

This would be quite generous of us, considering the miserable failure of Red Army attempts to capture the city during the Winter War.\n\nThe Russian demands are no joke, however, for they are quite insistent that these demands must be accepted or rejected in their entirety.
