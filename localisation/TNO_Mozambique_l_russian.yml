 ## Ideas ##
 MZB_Just_Another_Camp:0 "Just Another Camp"
 MZB_Just_Another_Camp_desc:0 "For Hans H?ttig, the running of a Reichskommissariat is no different than that of a concentration camp. We are not here to build a nation. We are not here to uplift the locals. We are the guards, and this is their prison. Any signs of dissent will be crushed, and the native population will mine and farm for the Reich until they drop."
 MZB_Aryan_Only_SS:0 "Aryan Only SS"
 MZB_Aryan_Only_SS_desc:0 "Whilst other elements of the Reich are all too happy to welcome degeneracy into their ranks, we can never lower ourselves to such a disgrace. The native population must know their place, below the German, and so the SS in Ostafrika comprise of full blooded Aryans alone."
 MZB_The_Unending_War:0 "The Unending War"
 MZB_The_Unending_War_desc:0 "Our colony is in a near constant state of warfare as countless native resistance movements carry out a persistent guerrilla war against our regime. Our patrols are ambushed, convoys stolen, positions raided and settlements burned. Even the fiercest of our soldiers have come to fear straying too far from the few beacons of civilisation."
 MZB_Filling_The_Stores:0 "Filling The Stores"
 MZB_Filling_The_Stores_desc:0 "It is important for us to keep our garrison armed and ready. We will waste nothing in our efforts to obtain more weapons.\n\nAnd whatever we have, we will keep for ourselves."
 MZB_Oberkommando_Der_Afrika_Idea:0 "Oberkommando Afrika"
 MZB_Oberkommando_Der_Afrika_Idea_desc:0 "The other Reichskommissariats are incredibly far from the reality of this war, and their incompetence is going to cost us victory in our war against the South Africans. To assert our control over our efforts, we have created a joint command to coordinate their efforts with our own.\n\nThe OAS shall see us through to victory over the degenerate Republic."
 MZB_Tribal_Recruitment:0 "Tribal Recruitment"
 MZB_Tribal_Recruitment_desc:0 "We've taken the liberty of choosing some significant natives as bodies for the front. They may be inferior to us, but they are numerous and they will serve our goal of winning this war.\n\nThe more they take the losses, the less we have to mourn over. They're just not Aryan after all."
 MZB_Kindersoldaten_Idea:0 "Kindersoldaten"
 MZB_Kindersoldaten_Idea_desc:0 "In order to solve the crippling lack of manpower, it has been decided to conscript inferior children from the age of ten into the regular army, in both support and combat roles. Their young blood will pave the way to victory for the Aryans, as it is both duty and honor for the servants to the master race: let the enemy look into their innocent eyes as they pull the trigger, and realize that, after all, they are exactly the same as the ones they hate so much."
 MZB_Simplified_Arms_Production_Idea:0 "Simplified Arms Production"
 MZB_Simplified_Arms_Production_Idea_desc:0 "There's no use in making our production plants sophisticated and grand. We only need what we need, and these are basic parts and ammunition. These things are what we need in great numbers but not in quality.\n\nAs long as we have a decent production line, we do not need to worry about anything else."
 MZB_The_Fatherland_Arrives:0 "The Fatherland Arrives"
 MZB_The_Fatherland_Arrives_desc:0 "Our Fatherland has come to our aid, and they have brought with them the necessities of war! With the support they have given us, their promises are, in all legal technicalities, fulfilled.\n\nHowever much to our dismay, the German support comes only in limited defensive and order-maintaining capacities. When it comes to driving the dagger into the heart of the OFN, we are still on our own. Although M?ller doubtlessly wishes for a more aggressive delivery of support, we shall still make full use of what they have brought."
 MZB_idea_a_hundred_for_one:0 "A Hundred for One"
 MZB_idea_a_hundred_for_one_desc:0 "The work of our Generalb?ro has surpassed our expectations. Our troops report soaring morale, and our high command believes that this can help turn the tide of the war in our favor.\n\nLet's make sure this is maintained."
 MZB_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_0:0 "The Preikschat-Schlicke Initiative"
 MZB_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_0_desc:0 "Thanks to the concerted effort in building an autonomous power line, now power has been brought to the entirety of Quelimane, greatly improving quality of life for the population. Of course, the fruits of Aryan ingenuity and hard labor should only be enjoyed by the master race, and not by ungrateful wretches..."
 MZB_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_1:0 "The Preikschat-Schlicke Initiative"
 MZB_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_1_desc:0 "The expansion of Quelimane's power line have allowed the colonial government to set up a surveillance network of security cameras all throughout the city, to protect the hard-working Germans from the dangers lurking in the dark."
 MZB_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_2:0 "The Preikschat-Schlicke Initiative"
 MZB_preikschat_schlicke_initiative_2_desc:0 "By order of Reichskommissar H?ttig, surveillance measures will be extended to the entirety of Ostafrika until unrest is completely crushed and the inferiors have been definitely subdued. No one will be allowed to endanger the future of Aryan domination over Afrika!"
 MZB_Insurgency_Training:0 "Insurgency Training"
 MZB_Insurgency_Training_desc:0 "German weapons and training have turned many of those Boers still living in Federation-controlled areas into a dangerous guerrilla. From secret hideouts, they strike against supply lines, production plants, police stations and isolated patrols, further destabilizing South Africa and greatly hindering its war effort."
 MZB_Burn_Them_All:0 "Burn Them All"
 MZB_Burn_Them_All_desc:0 "Schenck and his moral qualms about saving "innocents" are nonsensical, and will be dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic. From now on, Ostafrika shall field its own bomber force, ready and willing to perform its duty towards the Vaterland.\n\nThere are no innocents in this war. All enemies of the Reich are guilty of opposing the master race, and the only fitting punishment is to watch powerless as their entire world, their dreams, their hopes, their loved ones BURN."
 MZB_Surrounded_By_Degeneracy_1:0 "Surrouned by Degeneracy"
 MZB_Surrounded_By_Degeneracy_1_desc:0 "Reichskommissar Hans H?ttig is a lone, fortified island in a sea of degeneracy. Both inside and outside Ostafrika, evil minds conspire to put an end to the rightful German rule over Afrika, and the lax rule of foolish administrators only fuels discontent and chaos throughout the German Lebensraum.\n\nTo this end, he has embarked on a crusade in the name of all Aryans, to ensure that traitors, incompetents, hedonists, rebels and other degenerates all meet their long-due end: to be on the other end of a rifle barrel, or spend the rest of their pitiful life toiling for the good of the Reich in the concentration camps."
 MZB_Surrounded_By_Degeneracy_2:0 "Surrouned by Degeneracy"
 MZB_Surrounded_By_Degeneracy_2_desc:0 "Reichskommissar Hans H?ttig is a lone, fortified island in a sea of degeneracy.

 MZB_conscripted_additional_workers:0 "Conscripted Additional Workers"
 MZB_conscripted_additional_workers_desc:0 "In order to speed up preparations and supplies for the army in the face of scarcity of specialized workforce, the Ostafrika administration has ordered to conscript and train more laborers to work in the chemical plants and in the military factories, greatly increasing production rates."
 MZB_reduced_worker_rations:0 "Reduced Worker Rations"
 MZB_reduced_worker_rations_desc:0 "Our best instrument in war is our army. And our best chances of winning such a war is in that army. But without food, our army will rust like exposed iron, and we know how rust ruins instruments.\n\nThe order is set; rations from the workers shall be stripped and given to the army."

 ## Decisions ##
 MZB_booby_trap_the_border_category:0 "Booby Trap the Border"
 MZB_booby_trap_the_border_category_desc:0 "A war is coming, and at times the best offense is a good defense.\n\nArrogance cannot dictate our military strategy in the battles to come, and so we must be prepared for the possibility of losing territory along the border with South Africa. As such, by booby trapping our border regions as much as possible we can attempt to ensure that even should our forces be pushed back, the enemy will find the infrastructure utterly crippled."

 MZB_unified_holdouts_category:0 "Unified Holdouts Program"
 MZB_unified_holdouts_category_desc:0 "Whilst we must always pursue the offensive, we must also prepare for the defensive. Ostafrika is a vast territory, too vast to realistically form an effective defensive line across should we be pushed back into the African heartlands. By establishing centralized points of defense, across three defensive lines throughout Ostafrika, we can concentrate our defensive operations on holding key locations to delay and tie up any OFN offensive."

 MZB_fortify_quelimane:0 "Fortify Quelimane"
 MZB_fortify_quelimane_desc:0 "Our traditional capital in Ostafrika, fortififying this position is of crucial importance to counter any OFN offensive and protect the administrative and industrial assets of the region."
 MZB_fortify_sailsbury:0 "Fortify Sailsbury"
 MZB_fortify_sailsbury_desc:0 "The regional capital of Southern Rhodesia, and home to the struggling local British administration, the region is one of significant native resistance. Maintaining a foothold in this region is crucial to ensuring the OFN cannot breakthrough our center. Not to mention the chaos that losing Sailsbury to an unexpected native uprising would cause."
 MZB_fortify_lusaka:0 "Fortify Lusaka"
 MZB_fortify_lusaka_desc:0 "A backwater town far from any national importance, Lusaka holds strategic value due to its proximity to the Zambezi River. Losing the town would allow the OFN to break through our left flank, as well as potentially cut us off from Sudwestafrika."
 MZB_fortify_lilongwe:0 "Fortify Lilongwe"
 MZB_fortify_lilongwe_desc:0 "Almost directly in the middle of Ostafrika, and strategically placed near Lake Malawi, losing Lilongwe would force our military to be split in half for hundreds of miles due to the lake. Should the OFN approach the position, Lilongwe must hold long enough for our forces to properly regroup and co-ordinate."
 MZB_fortify_dodoma:0 "Fortify Dodoma"
 MZB_fortify_dodoma_desc:0 "Our northern stronghold, Dodoma and its surrounding region are home to a significant ammount of our industrial strength. Likely to be our only major source of arms should we lose control of the south, Dodoma must be a last stand position held at all costs."
 MZB_fortify_dar_es_salaam:0 "Fortify Dar es Salaam"
 MZB_fortify_dar_es_salaam_desc:0 "The most major port in Ostafrika, Dar es Salaam is traditionally where all supplies and manpower from the homeland arrives, as well as acting as home to our navy. Losing the port would be a major blow to our capacity to recieve effective aid from Germany, putting our entire war effort in jeopardy."
 MZB_fortify_kampala:0 "Fortify Kampala"
 MZB_fortify_kampala_desc:0 "The region of second most significant native resistance after Southern Rhodesia, Kampala has been designated to become the final holdout position. Should the OFN overrun the rest of Ostafrika, Kampala will be where we make our last stand. There we shall either break the OFN, or die to the last as heroes of the Reich."

 MZB_war_preparations_category_desc:0 "Conflict in Afrika is surely inevitable, and while our fellows in the other colonies may not care about preparing for such conflcit, we certainly do. Preparing for the war will also help keep the reichkommissar from becoming too consumed in proving the treason of Schenk and M?ller, a possible pointless endeavor."
 MZB_conscript_more_workers:0 "Conscript More Workers"
 MZB_conscript_more_workers_desc:0 "The Devil finds work for idle hands. The natives that we aren't shoving into mines and factories are plotting and scheming against us. We must make sure that all natives labor, day and night, for both the good of Ostafrika and themselves. It is such a waste when hearty, strong slaves waste their energy in fruitless rebellion."

 MZB_reduced_rations_for_workers_desc:0 "Native laborers whine and wail about hunger and starvation, but it's no more than untermensch treachery.

 MZB_promote_loyalists_desc:0 "Even dogs should be rewarded for obedience. Our "loyal" British subjects deserve a treat from now and then to remind them of our benevolence. In return they will act as model, upstanding citizens of Ostafrika."

 MZB_chemicals_for_guns_desc:0 "Firearms are a brute's weapon, a primitive tool given out to any large child who is sent off to slaughter other large children in the mud. Chemicals are too beautiful for the vulgar term "weapon." They are a higher form of death, destruction, and the exertion of the Aryan will."

 MZB_make_examples_of_degenerate_ss_desc:0 "The men of the SS are the best our race has to offer. Strong aryan souls, composed in mind and body. However, strong as they may be, none may be forever free from degenerate corruption. Purity is not merely a racial entitlement, but an active mindset. If we wish to survive, we must make an example of cowards and traitors from time to time.."

 MZB_FOCUS.9.d:0 "Taking a sip of water to wet his throat before the broadcast went live, Ted Conway took a furtive glance at the man in the corner. He looked almost comical perched there on a high stool in his heavy uniform, glaring balefully around the room, his arms crossed and a permanent scowl plastered on his face. The craggy old devil reminded Conway of a ventriloquist's doll. He almost smiled at the realisation before he remembered that this man had the power to have him killed in dozens of unspeakably horrific ways. Paling, he snapped his gaze back to the sound board and put his headphones on.\n\nAs the recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto came to an end, the red AKTUELL sign flicked to life. Glancing down at the script, Conway took a deep breath and began.\n\n"Good morning, Reichskommissariat Ostafrika! Welcome to East African Broadcasts. I am your host, Ted Conway, joining me is my co-host Douglas McSweeney. Thanks to the benevolence of Reichskommissar H?ttig, we have been granted a license to broadcast an English-language radio-show to bring news, entertainment and the word of our Reichskommissar to you every weekday at five o'clock! Today we have a special bulletin on the ongoing enormously successful electrification of rural Ostafrika, followed by a report on the unprecedented economic stability the policies of Reichskommissar H?ttig have allowed us to enjoy!"\n\nDoug took over, reciting the carefully prepared propaganda they'd been delivered half an hour before the show. By God, being a Nazi mouthpiece made Conway feel dirty. Still, it was a paycheck, even if there was the constant threat of mysteriously disappearing should he ever slip up. He looked surreptitiously at the sour old bastard in the corner, trying to gauge his reaction, but he looked just as bitter as usual. It made him uneasy.\n\nConway sighed out of his nose, careful not to let the mike pick it up. Then, gathering his strength, he launched into explosively buoyant praise of the Reichskommissar's new mine expansions."

 MZB_FOCUS.10.d:0 "Pulsing through the cities of Ostafrika like blood through the veins of some vast slumbering beast, electricity slowly brings forth the spark of light across the dark continent. But only a fool would think that Reichskommissar H?ttig electrified his fief out of good intentions.\n\nSitting in his office at his enormous mahogany desk, kept glacially comfortably by a dozen oscillating fans, H?ttig flicked through a folder of maps of major Ostafrikan cities- Quelimane, Salisbury, Dar es Salaam. Marked out in bright red circles across each city were the locations of the new network of surveillance cameras that a battalion of slaves were already hooking up to the modern electrical grid. They were designed to give a comprehensive view of major intersections as well as government buildings and areas considered to potentially be hotspots for sedition. This was but the first phase of the plan, H?ttig thought with concealed glee. He'd already placed another order with Siemens for hundreds more.\n\nOstafrika was plagued with unrest from the barbaric simian natives and the seditious Anglo colonists, but they'd have significantly less success stirring up trouble for the Reich when he had eyes on every street. Machines never erred, machines were never disloyal. Once H?ttig had machines watching over all of Ostafrika, he could finally breathe easy, knowing that any threat to National Socialism and the objectives of the Reich would be easily detected. Gazing down at his realm from above, he could find and squash the traitors like insects.\n\nSmiling with grim satisfaction, H?ttig leaned back in his chair and was immediately assaulted once again by the migraine-inducing teeth-rattling screech of his chair. Instantly he seethed with rage. He'd tried everything to fix the damn thing and nothing worked, as a matter of fact it seemed to be getting worse. It was driving him to distraction, he couldn't work with that awful sound ripping across his eardrums like a thousand vicious knives. Centering himself, he decided to order a new chair from Germania.\n\nHe could not let something as ludicrous as a creaky chair affect him so. Resolving to bolster his Spartan discipline, H?ttig told himself he'd indulge in even less luxury in the future, even as he poured himself a glass of cognac. Just to calm his nerves."

Every year more Germans trickle into Ostafrika's quickly growing cities like water down a drain, eager to seek their fortune. With them come new ideas. Political ideas.\n\nReichskommissar H?ttig realised long ago that if dangerous thought is not uprooted when it sprouts, it will spread across the land like a vicious weed, corrupting all it comes into contact with. He had nothing but disdain for Ostafrika's intellectuals and petit-bourgeois, but he knew that unchecked they could infect the rest of his domain with radical thought. Slave liberation? What foolishness, when their prosperity came off the backs of the untermensch! Clearly wealth and comfort made people think too much. And what better way to dull the development of seditious thought than by filling their minds with propaganda?\n\nLike a wildflower sprouting in the desert after an unexpected storm, the Ostafrikan Television Network sprung up overnight to pour entertainment, sports and H?ttig-approved news into the minds of Ostafrika's more affluent citizens. As a special demonstration of the Reichskommissar's benevolence, brand-new Siemens television sets were given away free all Aryan and Anglo citizens, so that they may all share in the bounty of the modern age.\n\nAnd so the Ostafrikans took the television sets into their homes like Trojans receiving a wooden horse, never suspecting that inside every television set hid a concealed microphone, recording their every word. Ostafrika would never need fear sedition again, all watched over by machines of loving grace."

Another day home from school was fine as far as he was concerned, even if a vicious cold was the price he had to pay. Why'd he need to learn German literature anyway? He was going to run the farm, just like papa!\n\nAfter what for a ten year old boy felt like forever, an image finally popped on screen at the stroke of seven o'clock. It was the usual start to the broadcast day; footage of the Reich and Ostafrikan flags flying side by side as Deutschlandlied played at an ear-blasting volume. Godfrey ignored the boring old song as he wolfed down his breakfast. Much to his irritation, the image cut to a shot of Reichskommissar H?ttig sitting behind a desk. Boring! Couldn't they skip this and go straight to the cartoons? He wanted to watch the new episode of Captain ?ber fighting the Judeo-Bolsheviks!\n\n"Citizens of the Reich," began the Reichskommissar, "I come to you today-" ...and that was about when Godfrey stopped paying attention. Although he felt a twinge of guilt for thinking it, the Reichskommissar creeped him out. He looked like a porcelain doll, pallid and expressionless. While Godfrey got up to get a glass of milk, he listened absently to the Reichskommissar. He was saying that all projections for stability and economic growth had been massively overachieved, securing Ostafrika's place as one of the Reich's most prosperous regions. After that he rattled off a list of figures and facts that made little sense to Godfrey as the image cut to short clips of new gadgets going on sale in the capital and smiling blacks going to work in the mines.\n\nSitting back down in front of the television, Godfrey caught the final words of the Reichskommissar's speech. "Germans, Ostafrikans, be proud, for our great nation has proven the strength of National Socialism against barbarism. Together, we have created the most efficiently run state on Earth. Onwards, to an Aryan future!" Those words sent a thrill through Godfrey. If the Reichskommissar said everything was going well, then it had to be, right?\n\nAt last Captain ?ber began, and soon he had forgotten all about the Reichskommissar and his speech."

 MZB_FOCUS.13.d:0 "As stonily impassive as a marble statue, H?ttig stared across his desk at Clifford Dupont, Generalb?ro representative for Ostafrika's minority of British colonists and exiles. All shrunken and wrinkled, he reminded H?ttig of a piece of fruit that had been left in the sun for too long. Shivering in the arctic frigidity of H?ttig's office, Dupont was reading the treaty that had been drafted by H?ttig's underlings. It would give the Anglos gifts of land to develop in the uncolonized interior in exchange for total and unwavering loyalty to the Reich and a public endorsement of National Socialist values.\n\nPrivately, he thought it was too lenient. The Anglos had long been a simmering pot just waiting to boil over, and Germania wanted to give them land? But, he supposed, Ostafrika had vast tracts of land that, when cleared, would make fantastic farmland. Perhaps they'd prove beneficial to the Reich's prosperity, as long as he kept them within an iron grip.\n\nH?ttig had to stop himself from smiling as Dupont finished reading and deflated like a punctured balloon. If he had his way the degenerate Anglos would be deep in the coal mines instead of putting on a show of still being important dignitaries, but forcing them to dance along to his tune like marionettes was the next best thing.\n\nSigning the treaty would commit Ostafrika's Anglos to H?ttig and the National Socialist cause, in ink at least, giving him the legitimacy to prosecute them should they ever stray from the path. He knew Dupont and his cronies secretly wished to undermine his rule, cast him down and take his realm for their own. Feeling his suspicion coil around him like a boa constrictor, H?ttig wanted nothing more than to send this rotting old would-be backstabber to the camps with the rest of the traitors, but until he got the go-ahead from Germania, all he could hope for was to keep them under the jackboot.\n\nDupont, of course, had no choice but to sign."

When he'd been called into the Major's office and told he'd been hand-picked for an enviable assignment that gave him the opportunity to serve the Reich, he'd swelled with pride, picturing himself leading the charge against rebels in the interior. Instead he'd ended up teaching idiotic Boer farm boys where the trigger was on their K98ks. Stalking up and down the line, watching his men completely fail to hit their targets, Captain Weidmann wondered if this assignment was punishment for some forgotten slight.\n\nTo his mind, the men of the Herstigte Nasionale Party were nothing more than foolish, disorderly rabble with a heritage of unclear Aryanism. Unfocused, untrained and undisciplined, they were little better than the barbaric partisans and rebellious slaves, and he'd had the incredibly unenviable task of whipping a mob of sunburned yokels into a disciplined fighting force foisted upon him.\n\nIt was utterly ludicrous, and yet he'd had no choice but to accept his fate and slip into South Africa, eventually arriving at the HNP's secret training camp in a desolate valley where every breath filled his lungs with a thick coating of red dust. As he watched one of the Boers look down the barrel of his gun to check if it was loaded, Captain Weidmann wondered how Reichskommissar H?ttig had ever come upon the idea that the HNP could be useful in the coming war as anything other than cannon fodder.\n\nSighing as one of the Boers narrowly missed shooting himself in the foot, Captain Weidmann called for a break and went to wash the dust from his throat with a lukewarm beer."

 MZB_FOCUS.15.d:0 "Shielding his eyes from the harsh morning sun, James Cumberdale squinted down the driveway at the cloud of dust drifting in the wake of the family Volkswagen as his wife took Godfrey to school in Fort Victoria. Sipping tea on the balcony of the plantation estate that had been his father's, and his father's before him, James enjoyed the warmth of the rising sun loosening his rheumatic joints as he gazed over the fields of swaying hemp, stretching as far as the eye could see. Soon it would be time to wake the slaves.\n\nFinishing his tea, James stepped indoors to the drawing room to re-read the telegram he had received the prior afternoon. Try as he might, he couldn't find the hidden catch. According to the official telegram, the Reichskommissar had approved the provision of additional funds for British planters to exploit undeveloped land, for their mutual prosperity. The Deutscher Rhodesien Baufonds, they called it. If James' hastily learned German served him right, that translated as German Rhodesian Building Fund.\n\nJames sunk into his most comfortable chair, spreading himself around until he felt comfortable. Then he read it again. Life under the Nazis hadn't been as bad as he'd been expecting; for the most part they left the British colonists in their new Reichskommissariat alone, but there had always been an underlying tension between the British and their new German overlords. And yet, as of late they'd been oddly conciliatory. First they'd permitted English-language radio broadcasts, then they'd granted British planters vast tracts of land in exchange for a meaningless pledge of loyalty he had happily given. They'd even given him a free television set, where Godfrey liked to plant himself on the weekends when he should have been doing his Aryan Biology homework. The Reichskommissar never did anything out of the goodness of his heart, so what exactly did he expect to get out of this?\n\nSlipping the telegram into his suit pocket, James stepped back outside to watch his overseers herd slaves into the fields. In his grandfather's time, all of this land had been untamed. If these funds came through, perhaps they'd give him the chance to stamp his own mark on Africa."

Taking a moment to look up from the maps sprawled over the table, he felt a thrill of quiet accomplishment run through him as he gazed upon the orderliness of his design. Soon, all of Ostafrika would be remade in its image, ordered, disciplined, efficient, everything and everyone in their proper place.\n\nBut, until the dawn of that golden future, there was work to be done. Tearing himself away from the view, H?ttig focused his attention back to the pile of maps, already darkening as the light faded. He would have to order a slave to bring him a lantern; he was enjoying the evening serenity too much to return to his office. With a single ivory finger he traced the border between Ostafrika and South Africa, the border that, when his carefully laid plans come to fruition, would soon cease to exist.\n\nNevertheless, although his troops were better disciplined, trained and equipped than the South African rabble, he was not fool enough to think victory a certainty until the flag of the Reich was raised over Cape Town. Until then, he devised contingency after contingency, should the unthinkable come to pass and the enemy push into Ostafrika.\n\nIn case that ludicrous plausibility came to pass, he had ordered the entire border mined and riddled with traps to cut down the advancing forces of the enemy. Nowhere was left open for the degenerates to enter Ostafrika unscathed. With their forces getting blown apart like sausages in a pan for every step they took, their forces would get slowed sufficiently for H?ttig's crack troops to crush their advance and push them to the sea.\n\nH?ttig turned his head to look into the distant, dusky horizon. Any day now the degenerates and subhumans could come. He could almost see the simian horde cresting over the hills.\n\nWhen they came, they'd find him waiting for them."

 MZB_FOCUS.17.d:0 "A darkened room somewhere in South Africa. The orange rays of afternoon slither in between the venetian blinds. A thin, lean man with oiled sandy blonde hair stands before a corkboard, puffing at a cigarette, the smoke rising to be whirled around the room by a violently rotating ceiling fan. The man cocks his head as he regards the corkboard. Outside are the sounds of late afternoon traffic, but the man does not hear them, focused as he is on the intricacy of his design.\n\nA dozen or so black-and-white portrait photographs, many of them taken from furtive angles, crowd the corkboard. White string wrapped around the pins of each photograph connects them to each other. One photograph in the centre of the corkboard is connected to all of the others. Its subject is a middle-aged man with a pale, craggy face, facing towards the camera.\n\nThe smoker finished his cigarette and lit another. He moved closer to the corkboard, absorbed by the central photograph. The man's name, written on the photograph in black marker, was Ian Smith, a former British colonist from Simbabwe who escaped into South Africa after the Reich had taken over. After building himself a new farm in Vryburg, Smith had vocally criticised Reichskommissar H?ttig and the new regime, and had become a prominent advocate for the rights of the British colonists and exiles still in Ostafrika.\n\nIn other words, he had become a nuisance. Unrolling the string and unpinning the photograph, the smoker slipped it into his jacket pocket. So, the Reichskommissar wanted to destabilise South Africa with a political assassination, did he? Well, what better way to achieve that than to assassinate one of the most publicly outspoken Anglos and pin it on the Boers?\n\nHe picked up the telephone, dialling his handler in Quelimane, and in doing so knocked down the first domino that would send South Africa spiralling into anarchy."

All around him, officers in uniform walked to and fro with a true sense of urgency, communicating points of updated information or passing off newly minted documents. Despite the nerves that lingered within him, H?ttig could almost bounce with excitement. This was his element, and it was showtime.\n\nThe Reichskommissar proceeded to the grand table in the center of this converted meeting hall, upon which a large and impressively detailed map sat, speckled with different icons representing the locations of Ostafrikan forces in the field. A posse of generals stood rigidly at attention around the map, and snapped a salute to H?ttig as he approached. H?ttig swiftly gave a sharp salute in return, as they all stood at ease and got to the business of the day. The business of warfare.\n\n"Gentlemen, let us not waste any time with officialities or pleasantries today. We have a war to fight." H?ttig began, wasting not one moment in arriving to his point. "Currently, where do we stand? What are our vulnerabilities, and where?" he finished, staring at his Generals, as they looked to one another for an answer, following such an unexpectedly rapid commencement of business. "The Zambezi river, sir," piped up an old Generalleutnant. "We have token forces ready to respond to a crossing, but if the South Africans arrive in force, they may break through.\n\nH?ttig waved his hand dismissively at the general. "They'd be throwing themselves into a waste of forests and savages. If that's what they wish to expend their forces conquering, then so be it." he retorted, "The Boers have the South Africans nicely preoccupied at this moment. I want to know where we can attack." Several of the generals in the room murmured amongst one another unexpectedly, as if they had never conceived the notion that their superior would have wished to order an attack three minutes into the first meeting of the war. As H?ttig began to deliver an icy vexed stare at his Generals, a Gruppenf?hrer quickly piped in. "The SS divisions 'Verbante' and 'J?ger' stand ready for any operations, sir. You need only say where and when." H?ttig smiled at the response. "Then let it be so!" he replied jovially. Pointing at the South African coast upon the map, he finished his set of orders; "They won't see a single moment of rest against us. Not one. They will re-learn the meaning of Blitzkrieg.""

His mother never liked them, especially when they hit people with their guns, but ever since they made his father disappear, she always called them the "mashetani giza" - the dark devils. However, none of that mattered now. All Muchoki had to be concerned about was waking up early enough to go to the caves, mine as long as he could, and finally get out for dinner.\n\nHowever, as the day began, young Muchoki knew that something was amiss, especially as the smoke rose into the air and a small metal truck followed by a bigger one pulled into the village, sending all of the adults he knew scattering to their homes. Quickly, a shorter, older man got out of the small truck, barking and yelling at the mashetani giza. Muchoki's German lessons were going slow, but he could hear him yelling something about the children. It was then that a shiver ran down his spine, as they began kicking down doors, forcefully carrying children into the large truck. Suddenly, with an angry point of a black glove, the older man ordered the devils to grab Muchoki himself, forcing them away from his crying mother and into the back of the huge truck, as it roared to life and carried him away from his village.\n\nAbdu, Darweshi, Njowga, and a few other of Muchoki's friends joined him in the tightly packed truck, and hours away to a new, loud, and scary place. The Devils ordered them out the truck, and marched them into a dark, concrete room. There, the short man began yelling at them in German, pointing to some smaller versions of what the devils wore themselves. They all began to put them on, and were marched away, destined for a long field where they each got a German-made rifle and were told to shoot, and shoot, and shoot, and figure out how to put the bullets back in. If they didn't, they were beat, and went without dinner, as Muchoki would learn on his first night.\n\nFinally, after weeks of this cycle, and a bit of learning some more German, Muchoki and his friends were brought on truck out into an open savannah, where they began digging trenches. It was there that the bullets started being fired towards them, and everyone had picked up their guns and shot back. When the big truck with the cannon on top slugged forward, the short man climbed on top the trenches, yelling and screaming, demanding they shoot better or else they wouldn't be fed for a week. It was there that Muchoki felt the blood and grey matter splash across his face as the short man's head collapse upon itself, and he fell into the trench. Muchoki could only hear gunfire, foreign screaming, and the cries of his friends as the men on the hill came near."

After all, the only danger to a camp this far behind the front lines was the occasional German bomber that slipped through the cracks of the American air defense.\n\nAs the lieutenant finished his thought, he heard the distinctive sound of one of the flying machines, growing closer by the second. A quick glance up over the trees, and it was clear that the plane was a few things. It was a jet, it was German, and it was flying straight for the platoon.

Could the others tell he'd let himself get drunk? Surely not, surely not. Besides, this was a once-off. A celebration.

 MZB_FOCUS.172.d:0 "It was past midnight. Deeply ensconced in his favourite armchair, H?ttig sipped at a glass of cognac, ignoring the murmuring chatter around him. His most important subordinates were gathered to drink, smoke and await the phone call they knew was coming. Nursing his glass, and beginning to feel slightly tipsy, H?ttig slowly looked around the room. Baer and Chmielewski were there, as was Mengele, for once. He took a few deep breaths, trying to get back under control. Perhaps, he thought, this ought to be his last drink. He mustn't disgrace himself in front of everyone.\n\nThe shrill ringing of the telephone put a sudden end to his underlings' prattle. When H?ttig made no move, Baer stepped forward and picked up the receiver. He stood there for a while, listening and growing more and more puzzled. "Ja. Ja, danke."\n\nHanging up, Baer turned to the gathered dignitaries and announced with utter bewilderment that the operation had failed, with the Ostafrikan assassins being unable to find Smith, and yet, somehow, Smith had still bee killed. Still staring into the middle distance, H?ttig heard his underlings debate what could possibly have happened, eventually deciding it must have been the Boers having the same idea. Realising the men were all looking to him, expecting him to say a few words, H?ttig set down the empty glass and stood. Thankfully, he didn't stumble or sway.\n\n"Men, today we triumph once more. Though our bullet went astray, it is clear that the Judeo-degenerate state of South Africa needs little encouragement to collapse from the rot within. Long live National Socialism and long live the F?hrer!" Was he slurring? He couldn't tell. He felt a moment of trepidation as he looked into Baer and Chmielewski's eyes. Could they tell?\n\nAlthough most still looked utterly baffled at this turn of events, his men seemed emboldened. Feeling drowsy and embarrassed, H?ttig sank once more into his armchair. So, Ian Smith was dead. That ought to shake the decaying decadents of South Africa up a bit, but for some reason, he found it difficult to care about it right this minute.

 MZB_FOCUS.173.d:0 "H?ttig sat motionless behind his desk, staring at the ceiling, as he had been for some time. Waking at one o'clock in the afternoon with a churning stomach and a bad case of cottonmouth, he had stumbled to his office, and, when he found that attempting anything resembling a thought gave him the sensation of a pair of icepicks being forced through his eyes, the Reichskommissar had decided to spend some time recovering his faculties.\n\nSo this was a real hangover. It bore little resemblance to those pathetic little headaches he used to get as a boy when he filched a few of his father's beers, which he now realized were a dim shadow of the real thing. Groaning, he leaned forward to stare at his desk. It was stacked high with the paperwork, missives, reports, memos, orders, telegrams, letters, requests, demands, transcripts, bulletins, dispatches and tidings fair and ill that had accumulated since the prior afternoon. Wanting nothing more than to dive over the palace balcony to the gravel below at the thought of answering them, must less the horrific prospect of having to categorize them, he found his eyes drawn to the morning newspaper sporting the tantalizing headline IAN SMITH SHOT IN VRYBURG!\n\nThough every cell in his body screamed at him, H?ttig watched himself pick the newspaper up and begin to read. His stomach swirled like a whirlpool as he attempted to digest what the newspaper was telling him. Oddly, almost all of the details on Smith's death mentioned in the article were different from those he had been given by his intelligence officers at the party the evening before.\n\nWere his men so incompetent they couldn't get correct intel on their own operation? Or had someone else gotten to Smith before they could, and they had taken credit for it either mistakenly or intentionally, in the hope of increasing their prestige on the backs of the real assassins? If his suspicions were correct, and Smith had been taken out by a third party, then it appeared to prove that South Africa's spiral into the abyss was happily progressing on its own and didn't need the extra push.\n\nAt least that's what he would have thought, had he been capable of cogitation. With only a few neurons firing haphazardly, he leaned back in his chair, felt that familiar creak deep in his bones, and, teeth clenched, resolved never to drink again.\n\nOf course, he had a glass of cognac in his hand within an hour."

 MZB_FOCUS.174.d:0 "Ian Smith, a South Rhodesian ?migr? and United Party MP for the Cape Province, was shot today outside of Vryburg Airport after returning home from Parliament. MP Smith, a staunch unionist known for his fiery speeches condemning both Boer separatism and universal black suffrage, was entering a limousine outside the terminal at noon. A masked man approached him, fired a revolver four times into his back, and fled in a grey car driven by an accomplice.\n\nDespite the police's best efforts, it seems that all their leads have turned into dead ends. None of the eyewitness reports consistently identified the type of revolver the man used, or the make and model of the car he drove. Some claim that the assassin yelled "For the ANC," while others insist he yelled "Boers shall be free." Smith was a man with many enemies in both the Boer and black communities of Vryburg, so neither group can be fully placed above suspicion.\n\nThe investigation's shortcomings, however, have failed to deter Smith's supporters and constituents from demanding justice be served. What shall we do?"

 MZB_FOCUS.18.d:0 "Flicking a switch, the drill sergeant killed the lights. For a moment the only sounds were the ceiling fan whipping the fetid tropical air around the room and the gathered soldiers shifting in their seats.\n\nAnother flick, the whirling of a film projector. An image appeared on the wall, accompanied by boisterous military music. AFRICA: YOUR DUTY! The title card cut to a montage of shots of natives; starving, loitering, training with shoddy weapons. Invariably they were shot at a distance, or from a high angle. "The African subhumans," began an authoritative voiceover, "seen in their natural state of barbarity. To a German, the depravity of the native Africans may seem shocking, even unbelievable. Before the arrival of the Aryan to Africa, the subhumans of this land existed in a state of animalistic savagery lower than all others on Earth, lower even than the Jew." Shots of mud huts, sparse fields, men with spears.\n\nThe film abruptly cut to classic low-angle shots of blonde-haired German soldiers, lines of tanks rolling down the streets of Quelimane, rippling flags, and so on. It was a slavishly amateur imitation of Riefenstahl's style, but the message was clear. "You are part of the Aryan vanguard, the force bringing civilization and the values of National Socialism to the untamed shores of Africa. We will civilize this land, we will cleanse the taint of degeneracy and decadence from its people. As the subhumans will often not accept their rightful place in our purified new order, it is your duty to enforce the edicts of the Reich in these, our newest and wildest territories." Shots of Germans with machetes cutting through the jungle, launching mortars.\n\n"You are trailblazers, entrusted with carrying forth the sacred flame of Aryanism..." and so it continued, on and on, in much the same vein, for two full hours. The soldiers, desperately trying not to appear bored in front of the drill sergeant, stared rapt at the flickering image.\n\nAt last the film ended, the projector clattering to a stop, plunging the room once more into darkness."

 MZB_FOCUS.19.d:0 "Fluorescent lights flicked on, one after the other, lighting the vastness of the warehouse. H?ttig's glistening polished boots clicked on the concrete floor as he stepped inside, Baer and Chmielewski hot on his heels, each trying to stand straighter and walk faster than the other, their jockeying for H?ttig's attention going once again unnoticed.\n\nH?ttig looked around at the immense shelves, stretching far in every direction. They were stacked with huge green crates, thousands of them. Wordlessly glancing aside at Baer, his underling responded to his unspoken demand for further information.\n\n"This zone contains medium-grade assault weaponry, Reichskommissar. Some will remain here, while others will be sent to our Boer allies or stockpiled in our network of hidden weapons caches in the south." H?ttig stopped abruptly, bringing the train of advisers, officers and adjutants to a screeching halt behind him. As H?ttig turned on his heels, Baer began to wonder if he had been foolish in drawing the Reichskommissar's attention.\n\n"And have all agreed-upon specifications been followed to the letter? For I warn you," said the Reichskommissar, raising his voice so all could hear him, "any hint of grift, the slightest indication that corners have been cut in even the most minute fashion, will be treated as high treason to the Reich and to National Socialism." Seeing Chmielewski smirk at the humiliation of his rival, H?ttig swung to fix him with a hard stare. "Something amusing, Herr Chmielewski? Do not forget that this stockpile represents our most important defence against the degenerates and the subhumans. These weapons must last us years if need be, and should we leave chinks in our armour, they will be taken advantage of with characteristic savagery."\n\nH?ttig turned back to the shelves of stacked weaponry, a note of weariness creeping into his voice. "Continue the acquisition of additional materiel. We can never be too well prepared, for someday the horde will come, and we must be ready, yes, we must be ready..."\n\nBehind the Reichskommisar's back, Baer and Chmielewski exchanged a look of concern."

 MZB_FOCUS.20.d:0 "Mildly tipsy from downing a few beers with lunch, Captain Markus Weidmann booted the flimsy plywood fence and watched it topple over, raising a cloud of thick red dust. That pathetic inch of insubstantial kindling topped with a coil of barbed wire marked the edge of the camp, the sole thing standing between them and any who might wish them harm. Whatever, he'd get one of the camp slaves to set it up again later. For now, he had a much more pressing need to satisfy.\n\nAt last finding a squat baobab tree out of sight of the camp, Captain Weidmann belched, undid his fly, and met that primal need that every man who's had a gallon of beer sloshing around in his stomach for a few hours is familiar with. Weidmann had been overjoyed when he'd been recalled from the Sisyphean task of attempting to turn Boer farm boys who didn't know which end of the rifle the bullet came out of into a sophisticated fighting force, but had soon realized the date of his deliverance was yet to come.\n\nAfter he'd finished watering the baobab, Captain Weidmann zipped up and began to stumble back towards camp. Seen from a distance, it looked even more feeble and ineffectual. In a burst of wisdom, the Reichskommissar had decided to establish dozens of new garrison outposts over the barren, arid nothingness of the Ostafrikaner frontier, stretching his already meagre forces to their absolute limit, and he had been chosen to man one. Thanks to a lack of appropriate funds, adequate equipment and competent officers, it had been a debacle from the start. In their first shipment they had received maggot-infested rations and a box full of boots without soles.\n\nNot that Weidmann gave much of a shit anymore. He was almost hoping that the degenerates would come and put him out of his goddamn misery. Every day was the same, infernal heat baking him in his uniform, filling his throat with dust. It seemed as though he was in a dream, one of those strange dreams where you know you're trapped in your own head but you can't make yourself wake up.\n\nCaptain Weidmann painfully suppressed a belch, afraid he'd inadvertently spray the contents of his stomach all over the trail. Well, he supposed he'd better find a slave to fix that fence before anyone noticed. If he was lucky, maybe he'd find a Negress attractive enough to force himself on."

 MZB_FOCUS.21.t:0 "SS Expansions"
 MZB_FOCUS.21.d:0 "Reichskommissar H?ttig flipped unenthusiastically through the dossier of applicants to the Ostafrikan SS. Most were from the army or were planter's sons looking for a better life. All were horrifically unimpressive, and some were dubiously Aryan.\n\nWhat a motley bunch of exiles and rejects he had to work with. Unlike the pseudodegenerate pigs Schenck and M?ller, he would sooner die than allow natives into the SS. By filling the ranks of the Sudwestafrikan and Zentralafrikan SS with mongrel dogs they annihilated any possible claim they could have regarding their advancement of National Socialist values in Africa. H?ttig felt his temples throb with hatred as the dossier in front of him faded away, replaced by Schenck and M?ller's faces appearing before him, contorted with laughter, mocking his dedication to the Reich and to National Socialism. Stomach foaming with loathing, he almost vomited all over his desk from the sheer violent distaste he felt for his fellow Reichskommissars.\n\nDesperate to dispel the vision, H?ttig forced his eyes shut, squeezing tears from the corners to roll down his cheeks and, saltily, into his mouth. Why did the Reich favour them? They were incompetent, wasteful, indolent, and a thousand other unsavoury adjectives! And yet all he ever got were the dregs, the scraps, while his letters on Schenck and M?ller's behaviour to Germania went ignored. It was infuriating, stomach-churningly migraine-inducingly jaw-clenchingly infuriating!\n\nRealizing he was losing control over himself, H?ttig took a deep breath and tried to calm down. He shouldn't pine for the attention Germania and the media lavished upon the other two. It was enough to be a devoted servant of the Reich and National Socialism, enough to be a pure Spartanist, a pure Aryan. And yet, even as the rage faded and the tears dried, he found it was impossible to banish that image. Were they sitting in Luanda or Hitlerstadt right now, laughing at him?\n\nThrowing aside the dossier, H?ttig yelled for more cognac."

The corpulent old reprobate across from him flinched a little, already shivering from the polar temperature of the office's dozen oscillating fans. Setting the glass down on the desk, just heavy enough to make a clink, H?ttig asked his underling, "Why do we fight, Baer?"\n\nBaer stuttered as he searched for the answer H?ttig wanted. "Er, to achieve victory, Reichskommissar?" Making Baer pale with a look of the utmost contempt, H?ttig rose and began to pace around the room, followed by Baer's nervous eyes. "Victory. Yes, Baer, we seek victory. Victory for our beloved Reich, for our F?hrer, and for the immortal science of National Socialism. We fight so that we may purify this land, scour away the barbarity, savagery and degeneracy of Africa, and erect a new edifice in its place, a monument to the Aryan will to prevail against all odds. Pure, Baer. We will make Africa pure. But, what would we do if the unthinkable came to pass, if, against all probability, the barbarians should prevail?"\n\n"Er, ah..." stuttered Baer as H?ttig loomed over him. "We must continue the fight, Baer! To the last man! We must make them pay for every inch of blood-watered soil! If we cannot rule Ostafrika, nobody will!" H?ttig strode back behind his desk and took his seat. "You will form a new unit comprised of our most skilled and trustworthy men. They will be known as the Werw?lfe. Ensure that they are trained in sabotage, guerrilla warfare and anti-occupation tactics." Spearing Baer with another sharp glance, H?ttig continued in a subdued tone, "Understand that this must be of the greatest secrecy. Although this is a contingency plan, we must not give the impression we are in any way preparing for defeat."\n\nPouring himself another glass of cognac, H?ttig looked up to find Baer frozen in place.

At last, trying their best to look unflappable, his underlings had arrived by helicopter and chauffeured sedan and were seated in the palace's enormous conference room.\n\nThe meeting was not without purpose. Always feeling the knife hovering behind his back, H?ttig had become suspicious of anti-National Socialist tendencies among some of his officers. Eyes narrowed, he looked around the table, glancing at each man in turn, noting who flinched, and, more important, who didn't. Could anyone on the Generalb?ro have Speerist sympathies? To anyone but H?ttig, that would have been unthinkable. Eyeing his generals, he made the mental note to have them put under even more thorough surveillance.\n\n"Men," he began, as the last servant left the room, "we live in precarious times. I will be brief. From the outside, we are threatened by the degenerates and the Judeo-Capitalists. From within, on the borders of the Reichskommissariat, we are troubled by rebels, escaped slaves and so-called revolutionaries. Though we may expect that the racial purity of our men will lead us to victory, triumph is not assured. To prevail against the threats that face us, we must root out the cancer at the heart of Ostafrika."\n\nHe paused, looking around at his men, hoping for a reaction. Baer, looking nervous, always afraid of being replaced as the favourite. Dupont, grey-faced as usual. Chmielewski and Mengele staring back at him with their dead eyes. Stifling an annoyed sigh, H?ttig continued. "We cannot fight the barbarians when our own men are tainted by the stain of reformism. It is imperative that we root out the liberals in our ranks like weeds. They are not fit to serve the Reich, not even fit to call themselves Aryan. You will cooperate with my intelligence operatives in identifying and liquidating these traitors. We cannot allow these subversives to undermine National Socialism."\n\nThe conference continued, H?ttig laying out a plan to eradicate the subversives, all the while feeling that spectral knife draw closer and closer to his flesh. He had to scour the taint of treacherous thought from Ostafrika, without mercy, without quarter, before it was too late."

Feeling his stomach shift turbulently as he stood, he blearily stumbled to the dimmer to dull the lights. Slumping back in his chair, H?ttig told himself that overwork had led to him falling asleep at his desk. Obviously it had nothing to do with the cognac he'd been drinking since breakfast. Temples thumping, he looked over the desk, trying to remember what he'd been doing before he'd dozed off.\n\nIt all came back to him in a sudden flash of incandescent fury. After dinner, he'd received a telegram from Germania insisting that he cease sending critiques of his fellow Reichskommissars. The pseudodegenerates in their plush Mitte offices had threatened him, suggesting his constant criticism of those incompetent buffoons was tantamount to treason.\n\nHands shaking with rage, H?ttig poured a glass up to the brim with cognac, just to calm his nerves. How dare they suggest that? Downing his cognac, relishing its bitterness, H?ttig felt the fire of hatred grow in his belly. Not only could he not trust Germania, but he was surrounded by enemies, each waiting to sink their knife in his back.\n\nThe treasonous bastards in the other Reichskommissariats, the traitorous Boers, waiting for their opportunity to slip free of the Reich, the slippery Italians up north. It was like being surrounded by a ring of fire, the flames advancing, always advancing, until the day they'd sear the flesh from his bones. He could not allow the degenerates and the traitors to prevail.\n\nH?ttig leaned back slightly and immediately felt that horrific, bone-rattling creak in his chair stab into his brain like a million wicked needles. The blood rising to his face, something inside him finally snapped. Slowly, he watched himself rise, grab the chair and drag it outside to the balcony, into the bracing night air. Hauling it onto the marble parapet, H?ttig used what remained of his strength to shove the enormous leather chair off the edge.\n\nStaring into the lush blackness of his gardens, H?ttig heard the chair shatter on the gravel below. Swaying from side to side, he lurched back inside and passed out on the office floor."

After a moment, he wiped away the sticky tear residue that clung to his cheek and looked around. Somehow, he'd ended up in bed. Had someone carried him there, after he passed out in his office? He felt his cheeks burn with shame, both from the indignity of being treated like a child and the added humiliation that everyone in the palace had probably already heard about it. Head thumping like a jackhammer, H?ttig lay in bed for over an hour, staring up at the ceiling. He would have to re-establish his authority.\n\nHe heard a tentative knock at the door. Although he didn't respond, he heard it creak open, and turned to see who dared disturb him. Baer, fawningly shuffling towards him. H?ttig wanted to yell at him to get out, but he just couldn't summon the energy. All he could do was croak, "Tell me what you want."\n\n"Ah, Reichskommissar, allow me to extend to you my deepest sympathies that you have been taken ill," began Baer, sycophantic as ever, before he was stopped by H?ttig's stare of piercing contempt. Even mired in the pits of the worst hangover of his life, he knew he still held power over the disgustingly corpulent lickspittle. "Er, well, the Generalb?ro are concerned about the commitment of our Boer allies. I knew to bring it to you immediately." Yes, thought H?ttig, so that you might squeeze a few kudos out of me. Pathetic.\n\n"Must you bother me with every little thing?" demanded H?ttig scratchily, turning to glare at Baer. "It is simple. Emphasise to them, in a propaganda campaign, that we fight the same fight, have the same enemies. The natives; they seek to destroy everything we have built, to annihilate the Aryan future. You will bring the Boers closer to us. Use whatever resources you need. Now get out of my room."\n\nBaer obsequiously bowed out of the room, thanking H?ttig for his wisdom. H?ttig frowned after him, wondering if it was time to put Baer out to pasture. Or into a grave. As a leader, the men who seemed most loyal to you were the ones to watch.\n\nGroaning, H?ttig fell back to continue staring at the ceiling, wondering if he'd find a new chair waiting for him in his office.

When he had received his new orders, desperately hoping for a transfer to Quelimane, he had instead found himself sent from his border garrison to this stinking shithole mine at the edge of Ostafrika. Twenty demoralized reprobates to watch over hundreds of slaves, responsible for keeping the titanium flowing. It was no wonder he spent most of his days in an inebriated haze.\n\nWeidmann wondered why he endured, why he didn't just pull out his Luger and put a bullet in his brain. After days filled to the brim with all the savagery and depravity the world had to offer, he was forced to relive it all again in his dreams. Feeling as though he spent every second in a waking dream, Weidmann had begun to wonder if he were going mad.\n\nAnd so it was that, staggering back to camp with vomit on his boots, Weidmann was the first to see the men coming out of the trees. Suddenly death didn't seem so favourable. As the savages shouted in their brutish language, Weidmann turned to run into the bushes, despite understanding in a sudden burst of clarity that he could not escape, that these were his final seconds on Earth.\n\nBoots crunching in the humus, he was suddenly reminded of the crunching of his boots in the snow as a boy in his native Thuringia. He felt himself drawn into a memory, tripping and falling in the snow, bloodying his nose against a rock. For a moment, he smelled the tweed of his father's coat as he was carried to bed. It was so long ago, now.\n\nAs the bullets ripped through him, roses of blood blooming on the front of his uniform, Captain Weidmann fell heavily to the dankness of the forest floor. As his empty eyes stared up at the endless void between the stars, he was claimed by a more profound darkness."

Reports on the build-up of rebel groups in the interior were nothing compared to the Ostafrikan racial census. It was one of the most frightening things he had ever read.\n\nAccording to this, the only census conducted since the establishment of the Reichskommissariat, Aryans were still a miniscule minority in Ostafrika even after the settlement programs. Though the racial purity of the Aryan clearly made them superior to the subhumans, the natives clearly had an advantage in numbers. Of course, he'd always known there were more natives than Aryans in Ostafrika, but that vague hypothetical was very different to seeing it written down in black and white.\n\nChewing his pen, H?ttig stared down at the figures, and, after a long time, circled the number of Aryans. Sighing, he began to type up a missive ordering the conscription of all Aryan males in the event of hostilities breaking out, which, of course, they almost certainly would. Although the Germans who had emigrated to Ostafrika, seeking their fortunes on what they were promised was bountiful virgin land, had been promised they would be exempt from being drafted, these were desperate times. If they didn't pitch in and do their part to protect Ostafrika from the savages, they would lose their homes, their families, their very lives to the slavering horde. Surely performing their duty to the Reich and to National Socialism was a small price to pay for safety?\n\nAnd even if it wasn't, it wasn't like they had a choice in the matter. Leaning back in his new chair, H?ttig smirked at the thought. All Aryans should be willing to serve their Reich, if needed, even if they needed a little push to do so.

Realizing he'd missed his guest's comment, he responded, "Ah, yes, quite."\n\nJames, his wife Marjorie and Dupont were seated at their opulent mahogany dining table in a pool of soft yellow light, enjoying a dinner of roast beef and gravy. Godfrey had been sent to bed already, complaining uproariously as usual. Slaves stood by to refill glasses as Dupont held forth. "Well, I suppose I had to accept, eh? Old Hans is quite the typical Hun and I daresay that without my voice in his ear, or," chortling, "his translator's ear, things would be a deal more hairier for us Brits down here!" Dupont finished his wine and held it behind him, where it was dutifully refilled.\n\nWondering if there was some better way to broach the subject, James asked, "Cliff, while you were in Quelimane, did you see any indication that the Reichskommissar was building up the military?" At seeing Dupont darken and put down his glass, he quickly added, "It's just that a lot of us out here are worried about the instability that may ensue were there to be, ah, conflict.

I'm doing all I can to talk him down, but Hans doesn't much like listening to anyone who isn't agreeing with him." Following that, the rest of the evening was decidedly subdued, and all retired early.\n\nWhen dawn came, James stood with Godfrey on the plantation verandah, watching the slaves go to work in the endless fields of swaying hemp as Dupont's driver took him away down the driveway in a cloud of red dust.

He could sense the traitors hiding around the corner, ready to open the gates to the degenerates and the barbarians. They would destroy everything he had worked so hard to build. It could not be allowed to happen.\n\nTaking a deep breath, H?ttig waited with unusual serenity for Baer to finish scribbling. Chmielewski and the others were quietly chatting amongst themselves about a strike that had hit one of his new supply depots on the border the day before. Apparently, after slaughtering the garrison like savages, the rebel group that had done it had just left their dead to moulder in the dirt. They were certainly making the list.\n\n"It is complete, Reichskommissar," said Baer, jolting H?ttig from his reverie. Wordlessly, H?ttig snatched the list from Baer's pudgy hand and glanced over it, scowling at the names of the groups and individuals who threatened his rule. The list was to be made public, a propaganda piece to show Ostafrikans the men who threatened their homes and families, those treasonous, barbarous scum who would stand opposed to the Aryan future. Of course, they'd have to remove a few names from the list for the one they sent to their Boer allies. It wouldn't do for them to learn how many of them would someday face the pointy end of a bullet.\n\n"Very well, Baer. I approve. Thank you, gentlemen, you are dismissed." As his underlings filed out of the room, H?ttig rose and made his way to the balcony. It was a cool, refreshing evening, the sun just sinking below the horizon. H?ttig poured himself a glass of cognac as he looked out to the hazy, distant skyline of Quelimane, smog covering the city like a shroud. H?ttig looked down into the tenebrous verdure of his gardens. Orderly, pristine, pure. Slaves shambling through the gloom, maintaining the immaculation of his design, everything and everyone in their proper place.\n\nInhaling the crisp air of dusk, H?ttig awaited the dying of the light."

# MZB_FOCUS.174.d:0 "The Honorable Ian Smith, a South Rhodesian ?migr? and United Party MP for the Cape Province, was shot today outside of Vryburg Airport after returning home from Parliament. MP Smith, a staunch unionist known for his fiery speeches condemning both Boer separatism and universal black suffrage, was entering a limousine outside the terminal at noon. A masked man approached him, fired a revolver four times into his back, and fled in a grey car driven by an accomplice. Smith was taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.\n\nDespite the police's best efforts, it seems that all their leads have turned into dead ends. None of the eyewitness reports consistently identified the type of revolver the man used, or the make and model of the car he drove. Some claim that the assassin yelled "For the ANC," while others insist he yelled "Boers shall be free." Smith was a man with many enemies in both the Boer and black communities of Vryburg, so neither group can be fully placed above suspicion.\n\nThe investigation's shortcomings, however, have failed to deter Smith's supporters and constituents from demanding justice be served.

### Investigation

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.1.t:0 "Report: French Officers In Zentralafrika"
 MZB_INVESTIGATION.1.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Leopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - while he was hunting, which is guaranteed to last for several days, as well as ensuring most of his personal guardas are with him instead of guarding the complex.\n\nNo one noticed the infiltration, and the places have been fully restored after the mission so as to not arouse any possible suspicion. The search had almost proved unfruitful until agent (CLASSIFIED) found a false bottom hidden below a hunting trophy in the middle of the suspect's office. Inside were documents of mostly little value - small bribes and reports from the suspect's own security forces - with a single, important exception.\n\nA contract written in both German and French bears proof of contacts between the suspect and the French general Maurice Challe, currently located in the Free French remnants. The contract details the terms of an illicit transaction between the two: French officers have been "loaned" to the suspect to train his troops in exchange for substantial revenue, probably to be used to cover further illicit operations.\n\nSuch contract is valid proof of military personnel from a hostile power being allowed access to military compounds belonging to the Reich, and therefore to several security documents and military secrets, a conduct violating section 109-f of the Strafgesetzbuch (intelligence activity endangering national security), and punishable by death.\n\nWe advise further investigations on the suspect: while this would be sufficient against common people, the suspect occupies an important administrative position, and as such it is best to gather more material should one accusation be disproved or ignored."

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.2.t:0 "Report: German Equipment Sold to Free France"
 MZB_INVESTIGATION.2.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Leopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - while he was on official visit to Windhoek along with several important officials of the colonial administration, scheduled to return in at least three days. At first, the investigation proved fruitless, but when inspecting the chimney, field operative (CLASSIFIED) noticed a stone too clean compared to the others, which were black due to years of smoke and negligent cleaning.\n\nThe stone was removed without damaging the overall structure, and inside the empty socket was a voluminous envelope containing five contracts, written in both French and German: the papers detailed a purchase agreement between the Free French remnants and the Zentralafrikaner administration led by the suspect - whose signature is also on the papers - with the first buying several dozens anti-air batteries from the supplies sent by the Vaterland. Coincidentally, the timing of the contracts matched several reported raids against supply convoys, where those same batteries were supposedly "destroyed by native rebels"\n\nWhat emerges from the contracts - which have been photographed and then put back into their place so as not to arouse any suspicion - appears to be a fraudulent subtraction of military equipment from its intended purpose, which constitutes a violation of section 109-f of the Strafgesetzbuch (sabotage against means of defence), punishable with up to fifteen years in the concentration camps. The covering attempts themselves are false documents related to matters of national importance, therefore violating section 100-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (treasonous forgery), punishable with up to five years in the concentration camps.\n\nWe advise further investigations. While such allegations are extremely serious, the suspect enjoys a large popularity and several friends in the higher echelons of the administration: having more than one proof is heavily recommended."

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.3.t:0 "Report: Falsified Budget Documents"
 MZB_INVESTIGATION.3.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Leopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - while he was holding a feast in his private office, which prevented the team from investigating the suspect's personal quarters, but left the archives unguarded and ripe for a thorough examination.\n\nThe operatives spent the night looking through documents, and by comparing several budget reports and requests for funds, several discrepancies emerged. The first ones were too few to be considered anything of value, but the more documents they went through, the more it appeared clear that a key section of the colonial budget - the "military expenses" column - has been used as a proxy to hide several large transfers of money: the costs of the garrison personnel, as well as maintenance expenses, have been inflated by several orders of magnitude, but the later reports do not take the received funds into account, indicating their transfer outside of the colonial treasury.\n\nDespite our relentless effort, we couldn't locate the destination of the subtracted funds. However, the documents constitute false documents related to matters of national importance, and therefore a violation of section 100-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (treasonous forgery), punishable with up to five years in the concentration camps, as well as section 266 of the Strafgesetzbuch (embezzlement), punishable with up to ten years of prison.\n\nWe advise further investigations. While such allegations are serious, the suspect has covered his tracks with surprising ability, implying his employment of expert accountants to make the funds disappear: having more than one proof is therefore heavily recommended."

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.4.t:0 "Report: Friends of Zentralafrika"
 MZB_INVESTIGATION.4.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Leopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - during an official tour of the Reichskommissariat, ensuring he would be absent for several days. Unfortunately, the presence of his deputy within the compound made it impossible to gain access to his private chambers, but we managed to enter the archives.\n\nDuring the search for compromising material, agent (CLASSIFIED) found, within the false cover of a book, a list titled "friends of Zentralafrika" and containing several dozens names. While most of the names were either redacted, cancelled or outright ripped from the paper, four names were still legible: two belonged to exiled Belgian entrepreneurs currently residing in Free France, one to a prominent American diamond importer, and the last to an Italian businessman residing in Addis Ababa.\n\nIt appears clear, therefore, that the suspect has entertained close business relationships - enough to consider them "friends" of his administration - with at least four people belonging to hostile powers, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison. Further investigation is strongly advised: due to the important economic ties of the Zentralafrikaner administration, it is plausible that corrupt elements within the Ministry for Colonial Affairs overlook such conduct as long as it brings money to the treasury."

Agent (CLASSIFIED) waited for the night to infiltrate the headquarters of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - during one of his frequent trips to Hitlerstadt in preparation for a safari in the northern jungles. Having infiltrated his private quarters and personal office, left unguarded as the usual security personnel has left together with their master, our operatives began the inspection.\n\nAfter several hours of thorough search, agent (CLASSIFIED) activated a hidden mechanism in the suspect's own desk, revealing small room which contained the suspect's private archives. The folders were arranged in no discernible order - likely an intended security measure - and, with only a little time left before morning, there was not the chance to decipher it. However, in what can only be called a stroke of luck, our operative found a photographic album detailing the suspect's meeting with several prominent corporate suits: while most of them are German, one of them - which has been copied and then put back in its place - shows the suspect shaking hands with a Japanese man in his office.\n\nNot only are the two smiling at each other, suggesting a friendly relationship, but the desk is covered in documents, some of which are written in Japanese. Further investigations have revealed the man to be an important executive from Mitsubishi, one of the major Japanese industrial complexes. From the collected evidence, it appears clear that the suspect has been entertaining business relationships with members of a hostile power, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison. Further investigation is strongly advised, in order to strengthen the accusations with more evidence."

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.6.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Leopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) travelled to Hitlerstadt, following the trail of the French general Jacques Massu, currently residing in the Free French remnants: the Frenchman's name has been found in several documents contained within Leopoldville's archives, and by cross-checking all gathered information the team was able to pinpoint a location likely to have been visited by him. The place, one of the first restaurants opened in Hitlerstadt, is famed for his excellent service and cuisine, and it is a known secret that Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - has often visited it during his safaris.\n\nBy corrupting a former employee, disgruntled by the sudden termination of his contract, agent (CLASSIFIED) obtained a copy of the restaurant's key, and was able to enter the building after all personnel had left the place. As with most old businesses, the restaurant had an album commemorating visits from important people: as expected, several photos show the suspect drinking or eating, but one of them was especially important, as it showed him in the company of none other than Jacques Massu. The photo - of which a copy has been made - has been taken in the restaurant's courtyard and appears to be very old, as several buildings appear to be still under construction, but the subjects are still clearly recognizable.\n\nThe two men appear to be laughing and in the act of toasting, and their expression is one of great friendship and camaraderie, which means that the suspect has been consorting with an officer belonging to the armed forces of a hostile power, which, coupled with the reported leaks of several security reports from Zentralafrika, constitutes a conduct violating section 109-f of the Strafgesetzbuch (intelligence activity endangering national security), and punishable by death. Further investigation is advised in order to further consolidate the accusations."

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.7.t:0 "Report: Conspiring With Inferiors"
 MZB_INVESTIGATION.7.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Leopoldville, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) entered the bureau belonging to the personal secretary of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - during the night, and managed to recover the shredded remains of several documents from the dustbin. It took several hours to put the paper scraps back together, but in the end four documents were successfully reconstructed: three of them were inconsequential - security reports of no use for the investigation - but the fourth proved to be extremely valuable.\n\nThe file -of which a photo has been taken before replacing the scraps back where they had been found - appears to be the rejected draft of a letter sent by the suspect to Patrice Lumumba, an inferior who nonetheless commands a large influence in Zentralafrika. The missive clearly mentions unspecified "services" provided by Lumumba, for which he has received an equally unspecified reward, consisting in "the previously-mentioned exploitation rights in Eastern Kongo"\n\nWhile the exact contents of said services and reward eludes us, this is still proof of a business-like relationship between the suspect and someone outside of the public administration of the Reichskommissariat, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison. While not explicitly punished by any formal provision of the Strafgesetzbuch, this conduct is to be considered especially abhorrent to the Aryan morality as it shows the suspect is granting benefits to inferiors in exchange for bribes of unspecified nature. Further missions are advised in order to find out whether the suspect carried out more anti-Aryan activities."

Agent (CLASSIFIED) travelled to Hitlerstadt in his pursuit of people connected to Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - and his corporate ties. The trail has grown cold at the Hitlerstadt Resort, but progress has been made nonetheless, as the team has managed to obtain the register with all the names of the guest who have visited the resort in the last year by bribing one of the employees.\n\nThe reading proved extremely interesting as, alongside the usual German names, several foreign names have been found: while they aren't tied to any rebel or seditious organizations, several - Katagawa, Smith, Aldricci to name some of them - belong to foreign industrialists and corporate suits. While the reason for their presence at the hotel eludes us, it is certain that those people should never have been in Zentralafrika, since the central government has established a heavy embargo on any company or enterprise whose legal headquarters are located within any country belonging to either the Triumvirate, the OFN or the Japanese Sphere.\n\nThe fact that those people, who are emissaries from foreign and hostile powers, travelled to Zentralafrika and resided for several days at the same hotel is enough proof to say that these people had very little interest in a vacation - Hitlerstadt is, in fact, bordering a rather dull quagmire, and very far from the normal safari routes - and way more in establishing trade relationships with the suspect, a conduct violating section 333 of the Strafgesetzbuch (granting benefits), punishable with up to eight years of prison.

Agent (CLASSIFIED) managed to infiltrate the personal office of Reichskommissar Siegfried M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - posing as a taxidermist sent to check up on the suspect's numerous hunting trophies. Once there, he was able to set up a hidden microphone directly under his own desk, connected to a secret listening station established in an empty apartment near the central compound of the Zentralafrikaner administration.\n\nBefore the batteries powering the device ran out, which requested a second mission to eliminate any trace of our espionage, the team was able to intercept several conversations between the suspect and various members of his entourage. While most of them were of no actual relevance to our case, one of them has given us a glimpse of the suspect's true plans for Zentralafrika: speaking to Rolf Steiner - his most trusted advisor and unofficial deputy during his long safaris - he made several statements of penal relevance, the most important of which was to grant "more freedom of action" to the dozens of corporations running rampant throughout the Reichskommissariat. By doing so, they would manage to "get enough money to cover everything"\n\nWhile the exact context, and especially what they are trying to cover, still eludes our team, this is clear proof of the colonial administration accepting benefits and bribes from both national and foreign businessmen in exchange for a free hand in the resource-rich mines and jungles of Zentralafrika, a conduct violating section 332 of the Strafgesetzbuch (taking bribes), punishable with up to fifteen years of prison.

Even though no personnel was found on board or near the ship's location, this is indeed a very serious finding, especially since the ship appears to be new, in perfect conditions and very recently used.\n\nWhile we have found ample proof of the suspect's incompetence, the presence of a military vessel belonging to a hostile power can no longer be attributed to mere incompetence: this is enough to prove that the suspect has helped military personnel from a hostile power enter the Reich and establish a base of operations, a conduct violating section 81 of the Strafgesetzbuch (high treason against the Reich), punishable by death. We strongly advise further investigations in order to determine whether the Amerikaner personnel is still inside the Reichskommissariat."

Agent (CLASSIFIED) infiltrated the central archives of the Zentralafrikaner administrative complex during to the absence of Reichskommissar M?ller - henceforth to be referred to as "the suspect" - due to a visit to the mainland Reich, which required the majority of the compound's security personnel to escort their leader.\n\nThe search has been long and difficult, as the archives themselves are a maze of seemingly random and unorganized folders. Such mess can't be explained merely with negligence or incompetence, and must instead be deemed an indirect defence measure against inspections: our agents were forced to abandon any professional approach, and had to pick folders randomly to examine them as quickly as possible before leaving, to avoid any suspicion.\n\nOne of said documents, however, proved interesting. Hidden inside a seemingly harmless report was a photo showing the French general Jacques Massu, currently residing in the Free French remnants: what was most interesting was not the general himself, but the fact that he was holding - with a very pleased expression - a stuffed lion's head, and behind him was a crate with "Ein Geschenk" written on it.\n\nThe German writing stating that it was "a present" is a clear indicator of who the sender is. Only the suspect has such a "taste" for hunting trophies, something which evidently Massu shares, and no other German would be so bold - or so foolish - to send a present to an officer from a hostile power without protection from above. This is a conduct which learly violates section 100 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Engaging in relations which endanger peace), punishable with up to 10 years of concentration camps.

While inspecting the bureau for immigration, our agents made an interesting, if disturbing, find: inside a cabinet filled with old documents were dozens of empty identity documents absolutely identical to those used by the now-defunct French Republic, and still in use among the exiles. They appear devoid of any information, lacking both the photos and the personal data.\n\nThe reason why such documents were inside the suspect's central compound eludes us, but not their potential applications. By applying personal data on such ID, anyone could gain entrance to the Free French remnants, a hostile power, and since reports tell of a constant flow of political refugees escaping the French State to join their brothers in exile, it's very likely that they would reach Zentralafrika thanks to the fact that the French State is part of the Unity-Pakt: from there, they could receive new documents, and leave for their final destination.\n\nSuch practice would never be allowed to happen without an explicit order from above, which means that the suspect has taken a conduct violating section 99 os the Strafgesetzbuch (working as agent for intelligence service), punishable by up to 6 years in a concentration camp. We advise further investigations in order to discover how many Frenchmen managed to reach the remnants."

Among the other acts of debauchery which, though extremely unbecoming for an officer of his stature, hold no criminal relevance, our operatives managed to get a high-resolution photo of the suspect drinking from a bottle with "Glenlivet whisky" written on it.\n\nThe label clearly refers to the Glenlivet distillery, based in what now is the Republic of Scotland, and it is relevant as the Reich has ordered an embargo against the nation almost ten years ago, making it illegal to buy anything produced there. Sadly, we weren't able to discover whether the bottle had been bought by the suspect before or after the embargo was put in place, but should the latter be proved, this could clearly be a case of alcohol smuggling, and it is well known that no one gets such goods if not from the gates of Brittany by paying their government a lot, a conduct violating section 334 of the Strafgesetzbuch (giving bribes) in relation to section 335-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (foreign officials), and punishable with up to 10 years in a concentration camp.

Agent (CLASSIFIED) secured access to the army headquarters in Windhoek on a cover story of working on an audit from Germania. The operative was thus able to secure access to the reports and accounting records of S?dwestafrika. These reports were far more expansive and detailed than expected, and some time was necessary to search the documents. For simplicity's sake, the asset only looked at the past few years of the colonial administration.\n\nOn the surface, these records matched what we know about Reichskommisar Schenck's operations, and did not differentiate from what was sent to Germania. However, closer and more detailed inspection revealed serious indescrepencies in these reports. For instance, an airbase near Swakopmund reported that twenty transport aircraft disappeared between one month and the next. The next month, fifteen more transport aircraft appeared at the same airbase, with no explanation of what had happened. Many similar cases occur in the records, with items from rifles and grenades to tanks and fighter aircraft.\n\nThese indescrepencies may constitute false documents related to matters of national importance, and therefore a violation of section 100-a of the Strafgesetzbuch (treasonous forgery), punishable with up to five years in the concentration camps, as well as section 266 of the Strafgesetzbuch (embezzlement), punishable with up to ten years of prison. However, they could simply be a matter of lax bookkeeping. The sheer scale of the problem, on the other hand, lends credibility to the former.\n\nWhat is clear is more of an investigation is needed. This is scarcely enough evidence on its own, but it could lead to a far more sinister plot to defraud the Reich. We will find out what is happening with the equipment, and why the accountants in S?dwestafrika have become so lazy lately."

 MZB_INVESTIGATION.17.d:0 "Agents (CLASSIFIED) have returned from their operation in Ondjiva, and the results are promising. Agent (CLASSIFIED) was sent to conduct surveillance of a facility rumored to be a command center for the terrorist group UNITA. For several days, they hid in a concealed location, while they took note of various goings on around the facility. After successfully exfiltrating, our asset was able to give us many interesting bits of information from the reconnaissance, including a photograph.\n\nThis photograph is interesting for many reasons. First of all, despite being fairly well known as an area controlled by UNITA, the area has apparently not been interrupted or disturbed. Operative (CLASSIFIED)'s report states that local garrisons have apparently not visited the area recently, and the photograph shows no evidence of a bombing campaign. This is obviously a huge failure by Schenck's highly vaunted air force.\n\nMore concerning about the photograph is the equipment held by some of the UNITA soldiers. Several soldiers are holding what appear to be NF LAG G1 assault rifles. These are recent models, introduced in 1958. However, our observations reveal that at least one of these rifles has a metal stock and handguard, making it possibly a G1A1 introduced in 1960, or a 1962 model G1A2. It seems a shipment of G1A1 and G1 rifles had been sent to S?dwestafrika to outfit its army, but there is no report on why UNITA seems to have gotten them.\n\nThe worst scenario is that UNITA and Schenck have entered into some sort of agreement where UNITA is given weaponry and left alone in exchange for some sort of cease fire. This could fall under section 202 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Providing Aid and Comfort to the Enemy), punishable by life imprisonment or death. But until a link is proven, it remains speculative. We recommend that more surveillance of UNITA is carried out, as well as more investigation into the S?dwestafrika armed forces."

On a cover of fixing indoor lighting, Agent (CLASSIFIED) secured entry to the archives of the Reichswirtschaftsministerium S?dwestafrika. The aim of the operation was to discover evidence of fraud or deceit on the part of Reichskommisar Schenck. Although the results were inconclusive, operative (CLASSIFIED) procured evidence which has added an interesting angle to this investigation.\n\nWhile researching economic programs in Luderitz, the operative discovered a folder marked "Airfield Expansion." The topics weren't interesting, but inside was an interesting photo of something that seems to be unrelated. In the photo, marked only with an identifying serial number, Otto Herrigel, the Economic Minister of S?dwestafrika, is seen sitting and conversing with an unidentified native. Our field agent wasn't able to identify the other individual, but our analysts have been able to discover the person's identity. With a high degree of certainty, they believe the native is Sam Nujoma, head of the SWAVO, a terrorist group active in lower S?dwestafrika.\n\nAn unauthorised contact with a terrorist group is illegal under section 201 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Conspiracy), punishable by a year in prison. This, however, could lead to a far more serious charge if the nature of the meeting is revealed. If others in the S?dwestafrikan administration knew of this and failed to report, they could be charged under section 201-f. Unfortunately, until we gain access to the files behind this photo, or we learn through other means, we cannot know exactly why this meeting took place."

For simplicity's sake, the data was copied and transferred to our headquarters, where it was analyzed. Agent (CLASSIFIED) was able to send us copies of several reports, specifically ones that dealt with S?dwestafrikan oil consumption.\n\nWhen investigated, a certain particularity caught our attention. S?dwestafrika takes a certain percentage of fuel extracted for themselves, in order to supply their industry and armed forces. This number is supposed to cover only their expended fuel and nothing more. However, the number that we discovered has revealed they are taking far more than they need. Our estimates are that the entire air force and army could be on full operations, and they would not be consuming the fuel they use currently. Something is clearly amiss.\n\nAt worst, this could lead to a charge of Conspiracy to Defraud the Reich, which carries a variable sentence between 5 years and death, depending on the severity, as well as compensation and damages, as outlined by section 212 of the Strafgesetzbuch. It could be, however unlikely, that S?dwestafrika has put a system of fuel tanks online and is filling them, with the knowledge and consent of Germania. Or they have sources of fuel expenditure that we do not know about. We will continue to research this discrepancy and inform you of our findings."

As part of their cover job in the telephone company, Agent (CLASSIFIED) was able to tap the phone line from Reichskommisar Schenck's palace under the cover of standard maintenance. This has yielded a large amount of intelligence, most of which is unfortunately mundane. However, one particular conversation stands out amongst the others.\n\nTwo days ago, Wolfgang Schenck had been discussing matters of national security with Field Marshall Hellmut von Leipzig. Leipzig is the highest ranking general in S?dwestafrika, as well as the minister of State Security, so it is not unusual that they would be in contact. Neither was most of the conversation, which dealt with bombing raids throughout Africa. What is unusual is that toward the end of the call, Schenck told von Leipzig that any civilian targets were strictly off limits. Von Leipzig said this was not a problem, but Schenck demanded that he swear that no civilian targets were to be attacked.\n\nUnder F?hrerbefehle No.45, anything in the Sahara desert is to be considered an important target. Housing and food stores are mentioned specifically as targets to be hit. Of course, circumstances may prevent every target in the area from being attacked by S?dwestafrikan aircraft at this moment. But if they are truly attempting to avoid attacking what the F?hrer has told them to, the consequences are grave and serious.\n\nUnfortunately, circumstances beyond their control led to the asset having to abandon the wiretapping.

Agent (CLASSIFIED) had been researching the criminal records of various SWAVO terrorists, when they came across an interesting document in the file of Klaus Dierks, from Reichskommisar Schenck, ordering his release from prison.\n\nHerr Dierks is a German-born white resident in S?dwestafrika. Born in Berlin in 1936, he had gone to S?dwestafrika as part of a course on civil engineering. While there, he joined the native terrorist organization SWAVO and was known to be close to their leader, Sam Nujoma. Eventually, his activities became known to the Abwehr and local authorities detained him. He had been put into the custody of Windhoek Prison, where he was sentenced to indefinite detainment.\n\nRecently, it appears Reichskommisar Schenck took a personal interest in the case and intervened. The letter in Dierks' file was sent from Reichskommisar Schenck last march, and ordered the immediate release of Dierks from custody. It's unclear if Dierks has been released from custody, and if he has been in contact with SWAVO since then, as his file ends there.\n\nSection 118 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Obstruction of Justice) states that pardoning a convicted criminal could be punishable by prison under certain circumstances, such as the criminal being part of a conspiracy which the pardoning member is a part of. The situation of this release is suspicious, to say the least, and could fall under these circumstances if more evidence of a conspiracy is found."

Under the guise of electrical work, Agent (CLASSIFIED) was able to attach a wiretap to Reichskommisar Schenck's main phone line from his palace. This operation was able to continue for a short while before the wiretap malfunctioned due to unknown reasons and had to be removed. Although short-lived, we were able to pick up one useful bit of information from the operation.\n\nAbout midway into the surveillance, Schenck received a call from Siegfried M?ller, Reichskommisar of Zentralafrika. The content of the call is not that interesting, to be honest. M?ller calls Schenck out of the blue, and enquires how Schenck is doing. Once initial pleasantries are out of the way, M?ller invites Schenck to go along on a hunting expedition that he is planning for the near future. Schenck declines, saying he has extremely pressing matters. M?ller expresses his regret. The two talk about a few unrelated subjects before they say goodbye. M?ller hangs up first. All in all, the call takes five minutes. A transcript has been attached to this report for reference.\n\nWhat is interesting is the call itself, not the content. M?ller and Schenck use informal and occasionally crude language to discuss matters of import, all with a friendly tone. This suggests a high degree of familiarity and cooperation. Thus, it could be extremely likely that whatever crimes that Schenck is commiting, M?ller could be an accomplice in, and vice-versa. We therefore recommend this information be sent to the team investigating M?ller, to see if they have uncovered any evidence outside of S?dwestafrika that would be relevant. Finding out about the "hunting expedition" that M?ller wanted to have Schenck join would be extremely important for the investigation."

In the letter, he requests the receiver to contact him "through the usual way" so they may discuss a topic of high importance. The reason for a personal meeting between Nujoma and the receiver is unknown at this time. We have no way of knowing for sure if the sender is actually Nujoma, but handwriting analysts have concluded with a high degree of certainty that it is.\n\nMaking an unauthorised contact with the head of a terrorist group is a violation of section 201 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Conspiracy), punishable by a year in prison, with potential of a greater sentence depending on the circumstances of the meeting. The receiver of the message is unknown, but it was sent to the headquarters of the Reichskommisariat, and Nujoma makes reference to the receiver being a member of the Generalb?ro.\n\nThe letter was allowed to continue to its destination, in order to ensure operational secrecy.

Based on official reports and some insider knowledge, Agent (CLASSIFIED) was tasked with documenting Reichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck's schedule and visits in order to establish a profile. Initially, this was a mundane operation, with nothing unusual or surprising uncovered. But the evidence has led the operative to come to a startling conclusion, one that we believe is accurate.\n\nSchenck's schedule is extremely simple. He usually can be found in his palace, or flying his aircraft as a recreational activity. What our asset found, however, is there are occasional gaps in his schedule when he is not doing either of those things. These gaps are not minor, they go on for several days, occasionally. Believing it to be a mistake, our spy asked their sources for more information. There was none. There are times when the Reichskommisar of S?dwestafrika is simply missing and unable to be reached.\n\nOne could conclude that these periods of absence is the Reichskommissar shirking responsibility or work. Section 231 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Dereliction of Duty) declares this is punishable by two years of confinement, and more if it is in a combat situation, which S?dwestafrika is currently in. Unless there is a satisfactory reason for these absences, it is a credible case that Reichskommisar Schenck is unfit to command the colony of S?dwestafrika."

A successful infiltration of the Oberkommando der S?dwestafrikan Wehrmacht has allowed access to some detailed after-action reports. Agent (CLASSIFIED) reports there is one event in particular that is extremely interesting for our purposes.\n\nRecently, a supply facility near the city of M'banza Congo was attacked by terrorists, believed to be the Angolan seperatist force UNITA. The small garrison was reported to have been overwhelmed by the surprise attack and the numerous enemy. They were supposedly forced to retreat to a more defensible position, allowing the natives to escape with a massive load of supplies, chiefly medical equipment.\n\nBut our operative reports many things about the story do not add up. The small army garrison reported only a brief firefight before retreating, with no casualties. No rebels were reported killed or wounded. Most suspiciously, a flight of tactical bombers was taking off from nearby Malanje Airfield, bound to attack targets in the Sahara. They could have easily been contacted and asked to help, but they were not.\n\nFrom what we know, the story could have been concocted by native sympathisers in the S?dwestafrikan armed forces to explain a handoff of supplies to the enemy. Needless to say, this is a serious crime, and the consequences are dire (Strafgesetzbuch, Section 202, "Providing Aid and Comfort to the Enemy").

They had been observing S?dwestafrikan Luftwaffe operations for the past month, making careful note of targets and outgoing bomber raids.

And S?dwestafrika's Luftwaffe has been tasked with attacking threats to the Reich such as the so-called "Free-French" and Cameroon. However, it doesn't seem the S?dwestafrikan Luftwaffe has been deployed inside its own borders. Over the course of the month, none of the 338 sorties made by S?dwestafrika ever attacked a target inside S?dwestafrika.\n\nWhy this is the case is unknown. Our intelligence indicates there is a substantial amount of rebel activity that could easily be struck by enemy aircraft. And it wouldn't be too difficult to mount a mission in S?dwestafrika, due to the large amount of air operations currently taking place, as well as a shorter flight time compared to missions in the Sahara. This oversight amounts to a case of extreme negligence (Strafgesetzbuch, Section 112), which can result in an extended prison sentence.

S?dwestafrika has only a small number of native Waffen-SS soldiers, much less than other Reichskommisariats. The operative says the SS member had the insignia of a Untersturmf?hrer. It's our belief this individual came from the L?wen division, the only SS regiment of the S?dwestafrikan army. After consulting with the warlord for a short period of time, the SS man shook hands and left the compound unharmed, with no further action taken\n\nInitially, the asset believed the meeting to be part of negotiations for the warlord's eventual departure.

And the base was never attacked or otherwise disturbed.\n\nTerrorist sympathies in the ranks of the SS is a complete disaster, and must be corrected at once.

One of these items was a complete accounting of the S?dwestafrikan Luftwaffe's operations for the past three months. We have poured over it, and have identified an area of concern related to target selection.\n\nIn accordance with F?hrerbefehle No.45, the S?dwestafrikan Luftwaffe has been directed to attack targets in the Sahara, specifically the former French colonies, to prevent the reorganization of the so-called "Free French." This requires the complete annihilation of any facilities or infrastructure located in the area. On first glance of this target report, they seem to be doing just that, logging many airstrikes over the area.\n\nBut a closer inspection raises questions about the airstrikes. Most of them are in the northern desert, sparsely inhabited by anyone and hardly home to any insurgent activity. A smaller number of raids take place in the plains and grasslands to the south, where more natives can be found. Only a few missions take place in the southern jungles, hitting uninhabited places like Borgou. And no raids at all take place upon the coastline, believed to be the main hiding place of the Free French remnants.\n\nIt is unknown why this is so. The coasts have a larger degree of anti-aircraft protection, true, but they have far more inviting targets. This can only be cowardice or weakness, both of which are unbecoming of a Reichskommisar."

The Reich believes it is accurate, simply because Schenck himself says so. But we know better. We have access to the information on the ground, and it does not match the picture Schenck has painted of his Reichskommisariat.\n\nMany of the numbers do not make sense. They do not match our estimates for what S?dwestafrika earns and spends. A great deal of the figures cited are nonsensical, or seem to be constructed out of thin air. The expenses are way too high for the management of the colony.

One, it is frequently traversed by terrorist organizations such as SWAVO, UNITA, and the MPLA. Second, it is a border with a major geopolitical threat. Thus high readiness is expected of all the forces there. So it was a shock when our asset found a base near the border and a few kilometers away from a major source of rebel activity completely and totally abandoned.\n\nThe Agent was able to walk through an unopened gate, after they had confirmed there were no soldiers on site. They were able to walk into empty barrack-halls, offices, and storage rooms, all of which looked like the soldiers inside packed up and left. There were still appliances and blankets stored there, as well as a few uniforms. But the whole facility was empty. If they had not brought back pictures, we would not be able to believe it.\n\nDereliction of duty is a serious crime in the Reich (see Section 231 of the Strafgesetzbuch), and we have a horrifying example of it in front of us.
