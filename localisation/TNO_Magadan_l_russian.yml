 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC:0 "Во многом Михаил Алексеевич Матковский был полной противоположностью Константина Родзаевского. Там, где Родзаевский был догматиком, он был прагматиком. Там, где Родзаевский был искусным, пламенным оратором, он был переговорщиком, используя свой такт и политическую проницательность, чтобы склонить политических врагов на свою сторону. Там, где Родзаевский хвалил антисемитские инициативы чернорубашечников, Матковский презирал их бандитизм. На краткий миг их цели совпали. Результаты их сотрудничества принесли свои плоды. Членство в РФП росло и достигло пика, поскольку все больше и больше русских эмигрантов видели привлекательность фашизма.\n\nЗатем разразилась Великая Отечественная война. В то время как немцы вели войну на уничтожение с Россией, разногласий между двумя лидерами становилось все больше. Несмотря на разрушительные, геноцидальные намерения Гитлера, Родзаевский искал его поддержки, мечтая о России, свободной от большевизма. У Матковского таких иллюзий не было. Война Рейха против Советского Союза, а следовательно, и против России, обнажила их расовую ненависть к русским. Независимо от того, какую подачку может получить РФП, нацисты не включили в свои планы независимую Россию. Однако, верный своим принципам, Матковский и его клика хранили молчание и выжидали, наращивая свою власть в последующие годы.\n\nКогда пришло время, они захватили город Магадан у Родзаевского, изгнав лоялистов и официально расколов партию. Теперь, управляя своими владениями, Матковский стремится спасти Россию от разорения. Средства для достижения этой цели лежат за океаном, и это вовсе не японцы. Америка. Однако даже для такого опытного переговорщика, как Матковский, убедить такую могучую державу - трудная задача; и все же он не позволит простым сомнениям остановить его.."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_PETLIN_DESC:0 "В отличие от других высокопоставленных лиц Русской Фашистской Партии, Николай Николаевич Петлин был уроженцем Харбина, а не эмигрантом. Поначалу казалось, что разница минимальная. Работая в Харбине драматургом, композитором и писателем, Петлин вступил в Русскую Фашистскую Партию и был отмечен за свои заслуги в качестве политического организатора. Вскоре он стал лидером фашистской молодежной организации, а затем, наконец, занял место в Верховном Совете русских фашистов Константина Родзаевского. Робкий человек, окруженный личностями Матковского и Родзаевского.\n\nКогда немцы вторглись в Россию, Петлин в знак протеста осудил поддержку нацистского вторжения Родзаевским, уйдя в отставку. С тех пор он перешел к крылу РФП Матковского, занимая должность его личного секретаря, оставшись с ним даже после раскола партии. Петлин снова оказался на подъеме, и бывший вождь русских назначил его своим заместителем. Под руководством Петлина, РФП всеми силами пытается угодить США, обещая реформы. Обещание, который Матковский неоднократно нарушал.\n\nПетлин был там, когда Русская Фашистская Партия стала Русской Национально-Трудовой Партией. Он был там, когда они захватили Томск и Новосибирск. Он был там, чтобы отправить Матковского в отставку и осудить его за Дальстрой. На этот раз, Петлин клянётся, что он будет там, когда демократия вернётся в Россию. Ведь его судьба - искупить грехи Харбина."

 MAG_fascist_splitters_desc:0 "Когда-то РФП была единой организацией, свободной от гражданских дрязг, опутавших всё остальное в России. Но это единство не длилось вечно. Идеологические различия между двумя лидерами РФП, Константином Родзаевским и Михаилом Матковским становилось всё отчётливее с каждым годом, с каждым десятилетием. Наконец, точка невозврата была достигнута, когда Матковский захватил портовый город Магадан для своих целей. Он обещает построить свободную Россию, свободную от бедности и страданий. Сможет ли он выполнить свои обещания покажет лишь время."
 MAG_gateway_into_russia:0 "Окно в Россию"
 MAG_gateway_into_russia_desc:0 "Вождь выбрал Магадан как свою базу совсем не случайно. Бегеда этого тихоокеанского порта приносят множество хороших вещей. Камчатские и Аляскинские контрабандисты привозят в город многие богатства каждый день. Правительство вождя может расти с помощью богатств порта, что, в конечном итоге, сделает его более легитимным."
 MAG_fascist_renewal:0 "Фашисткая реновация"
 MAG_fascist_renewal_desc:0 "Видимо, вклад Матковского в общество окупился сполна. Ведь он сумел подстроить наш режим под нынешнюю реальность не откинув своих амбиций. А так же он смог заполучить поддержку за морями С правильным настроем и снаряжением, мы более чем готовы, чтобы объединить не только всю Сибиль, но и всю Родину."

 MAG_the_true_heir_of_harbin_desc:0 "Российская Фашистская Партия, как её звали в Харбине, уже не существует. Матковский и верное ему крыло партии давно разочаровались в политике и риторике Родзаевского, поэтому они взяли власть в Магадане, и устраивают его согласно своим идеям. Довольно партии копаться в грязи, пока страдает вся Россия. Хватит бандитизма, хватит риторики ненависти; Россия Матушка взывает нас защитить её, спасти от разрухи.\n\nДо того, как Матковский может вправду послужить родине, он должен убедиться, что правит сам, несогласия и сопротивления быть не должно. Хоть он и доверяет своему крылу партии, он обязан сокрушить несогласие в своих рядах. Те, кто подозревается в верности Родзаевскому, должны подвергнуться чистке.

He knows the smuggling routes in the Bering Strait, safe from the watch of the Soviet remnant navy currently stationed in Kamchatka. From the south, he also knows the ways in Japanese Manchuria, hidden from the sight of the Imperial Japanese Army.

Once up and running, gold will pour out of these mines, to finance the war effort in the Far East. With the excess revenue brought in by the color, we can afford a bigger army.

The faith of the peasant militias and dissidents shall matter little in front of an artillery gun. We shall charge down, anointed by the Lord, bearing the lance that strikes the beast of deceit down.

We should seek help in defeating this menace, once and for all.\n\nWe shall fight fire with fire.

Their large numbers also mean that they can exploit the gaps within our lines effectively, isolating active combat units and swamping them with a relentless assault of bodies.\n\nWe need to fight smarter.

 MAG_the_national_republican_armed_forces_desc:0 "The armed wing of the former Russian Fascist party served their nation well in the past, marching from victory to victory all across the Far East. That being said, it has become increasingly clear that this force of armed thugs and vagabonds simply won't do if we are to continue the campaign to reclaim Russia. While we have no shortage of eager fighting men, the Siberian National Republic still has no official organized military to speak of.\n\nLet us remedy this before it is too late. The green light has been given for the formation of our young republic's official ground forces: the National Republican Army. The NRA is envisioned as a well-equipped and professional modern force, capable of facing any kind of potential battlefield scenario. Building such a force will take effort, but any price is worth paying for an army worthy to serve in Russia's name."

 MAG_tactical_refinement_desc:0 "The current unit tactics of the Siberian National Republic's armed forces are mostly unchanged from the days of the Russian Fascist Party. While they worked well enough and allowed for our total control over the Far Eastern regions, perhaps it would be wise to move on to a more intelligent tactic than just running and shouting at the enemy with guns blazing.\n\nPast battles have proved that, while this approach is quite heroic in theory, in practice it usually results in more casualties than necessary. The newly established high command of the NRA suggests a shift towards more conventional squad tactics to minimize casualties while simultaneously improving our units' performance on the field."

Given the minimum level of training necessary and pushed out into the field without installing any real sense of professionalism, much of the army consists of rabid dogs prone to committing wholly preventable acts of collateral damage while, at the same time, being likely to turn tail at the first sign of danger.\n\nRigorous training regimens will be the key to turning this lawless rabble into a proper fighting force. The United States, a close partner of our regime, has one of the finest militaries on the planet at their disposal. Their troops' level of discipline is second-to-none, and we can only dream of building an army of the same kind of quality. The first step on that long road lies in overhauling the methods used to turn young men into soldiers, and we shall look to the American system for inspiration."

Our fledgeling armaments industry shall work round the clock to fill the armaments with high quality, modern weapons for our new recruits to use. If we can find ways to streamline the methods of weapons production, there will be no hesitation implementing them in the assembly lines.

Talented officers form the bedrock of a professional army, and encouraging strong leadership in the military would go great lengths in ensuring that the NRA becomes more than just a rag-tag band of brigands."

The wars were brutal and inhumane beyond reason, but our brave boys pulled through and claimed victory even when the situation appeared hopeless.\n\nTruly this is one for the history books, a fine ray of hope in this dark chapter of Russian history! The struggle is not yet over, however, and our heroes will need all the help they can get when the time comes to bring all of Russia together again. The forces who oppose us are stronger than ever, and it will take all the strength we have to bring them to their knees.\n\nBrave men of the East, we hereby call upon you to join our cause!

Torn apart in the midst of the Bolshevik mutinies and further damaged during our invasion of the region, they will need some serious attention to bring them back online.\n\nOn top of the renovations, a comprehensive expansion of the facilities is planned.

The fact is we need better guns, and lots of them. Ideally, standardized with all the modern bells and whistles would serve our purposes perfectly, but how to decide upon designs?\n\nThrough our ties with the United States, we could examine those of which are currently in use with the US military. From fully-automatic assault rifles firing intermediate cartridges to man-portable tank killers, the American arsenal is formidable indeed.

We need IFVs, and we need tanks.\n\nThe R&D department has begun an initiative fancifully called "Project Zmey": a research project tasked with developing modern fighting vehicles for the armed forces. Among the highest priorities are armored personnel carriers and main battle tanks, the bread and butter of any proper modern military.

The ships we do have could hardly be considered military vessels- being more intended for fishing than conducting war on the high seas. Before we can begin efforts to construct a fleet worthy of a newly revitalized Russia, a separate naval arm must be created."

This changes today.\n\nThe National Republican Navy will be established to stand guard over Russia's waters, and the few existing ships of Magadan will be reorganized into proper fleets commanded by the few capable admirals we have at our disposal. To accomplish the further expansion of the new navy, the port of Magadan must be expanded far beyond its previous capabilities.

Now we have a "fleet" of useless scrap heaps sitting in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky accomplishing nothing else besides being a major eyesore. Surely we could find a use for them?\n\nOur trade fleet needs ships, and some of these old vessels could serve that purpose handily. All they would need is some salvage work, and we could potentially get them sailing again. As for the glorified rust buckets that could not be useful to us in any possible scenario, we could always just sell them or break them down for scrap.

Like their ground-based counterpart, the NRAF is envisioned as a fully modernized air force, equipped with some of the finest aircraft in the world.\n\nThese dreams are still a ways off due to our present scenario, but the foundation of a proper air component to the military is a good first step.

The existing high command has been quite receptive to this idea, and a suitable venue in Chita has already been decided upon to be renovated into what will become the Chita Military Academy.\n\nThis is where eager young recruits will be shaped into proper commissioned officers, worthy of commanding our troops and leading them to victory. With a healthy supply of new officers graduating from the academy, the soldiers of the National Republic can rest assured that only the finest military minds shall guide them into the fray.

It's time for a constitution. In fact, it's well past the time for a constitution. But now we have a chance to right Matkovksy's wrongs. We must draft one now that will form the foundation of our republic in the years to come."

Он оглянулся и увидел комнату, наполненную доверху книгами, доставшиеся ему ещё со времен его службы в белой гвардии, и полуразложившимися американскими газетами, и особенно его взор заинтересовал стоящий в углу пыльный и ржавый граммофон. Его вид заставил Матковского улыбнуться: воспоминания о том старом здании в Харбине, танцах и вечеринках, и кроме всего этого – о огромной свастике, сияющей электрическим светом, обещающей новый путь для всех русских, оказавшихся там, заполонили его разум.\n\nКто-то нажал на дверной звонок, отвлекая Матковского от его занятия. Два грубых человека, одетые в партийную форму, зашли в комнату. В маленькой и неопрятной комнате они выглядели чужеродно, почти по-варварски. Они отдали неловкий салют, пытаясь устоять на месте. Один тощий, с клоком светлых волос, выглядывающим из-под его партийной шапки. Второй коренастый, с видным невооруженным глазом животом.\n\nПосле нескольких секунд неловкого молчания, Матковский посмотрел на них перед тем как наконец сказать: «Ну, и что же?». Говоря с дрожью в голосе, они назвали Матковскому имена тех лоялистов, с которыми было покончено сегодня. Матковский улыбнулся. «Спасибо, теперь вы можете идти». Когда он услышал, как дверная ручка была повернута, он вновь взялся за свой список. Сергей А., Бруно Б, Николай С. Он перечеркнул их имена густыми, чёрными чернилами, навсегда стирая их из истории Российской Фашисткой Партии. Держа в одной руки стакан с виски, Матковский посмотрел на своё отражение в мутной жиже и сделал глоток.\n\nЧасы идут. Звук дверного звонка. В комнату входят люди и называют имена тех, кого вычеркивают из списка.  Иногда, когда ветер стихал, он мог даже услышать выстрелы где-то вдалеке, в лесу. Список был завершён к ночи. Он мягко выпроводил людей из комнаты, поблагодарив за хорошо сделанную работу. Когда они вышли, Матковский закрыл дверь на засов. Запустив граммофон, он решил, что будет неплохо потанцевать, вспоминая о Харбине. Он запустил устройство и дал ритму взять вверх."

Щелчок. Два щелчка. «Эта хрень работает?», сказал грубый голос, и было понятно, что он сидел слишком близко к микрофону. «Ага, работает»"\n\nДругой голос, приятный баритон, начал звучать из другого конца комнаты: «Мы в эфире, какого хрена ты творишь?». Микрофон уловил колебания стола после того, как голос встал с него. Три удара по столу. «Читай по бумажке». Неловкая пауза. «Ты забыл отключить микрофон, да?». Тяжёлый вздох. «Что за ебанный стыд». Звук пролетающего электрического разряда после того, как микрофон был отключён. Хреново замиксованные песни вновь начали играть, грохоча в ночи первого эфира РСМ.\n\nЗвук прерывается вновь. Вновь слышен грубый голос, всё ещё сидевший слишком близко к микрофону. «Доброго вечера всем русским Дальнего Востока! Добро пожаловать на первый эфир Радио Свободный Магадан». Звук причмокивания. «Меня зовут Сергей, сегодня я ведущий, вместе со своим другом Васи…», голос Сергея стал тише, и пару секунд спустя он крикнул в микрофон, скорее всего повредив этим барабанные перепонки некоторым своим слушателям: «ВАСИЛИЕМ!»"\n\nБыло слышно, как Василий сел на стул. После небольшого вздоха он начал говорить. «Да, я со своим другом Сергеем буду сопровождать вас сквозь многие холодные тёмные сибирские ночи».

Он провел долгие часы в этом офисе, и его пальцы дрожали, когда он готовился снова печатать. Его помощники мало чем могли помочь; никто не говорил на английском, а попросить помощи у Матковского было бы неприлично.\n\nОн вздохнул и вспомнил слова Матковского. "Убеди человека в Белом Доме" сказал он, глядя в глаза Николая. "Это всё". Матковскому не нравилось, когда к нему относились легкомысленно. В лучшие времена, Петлин мог увидеть дух старого Харбина в нём, дух надежды, мольбу о новом доме. Зима принесла свои плоды, а сухие, покрасневшие щеки были лишь симптомами оплаты.\n\nОн снова посмотрел на свой стол. Столбы бумаги возвышались над ним. Скоро они будут отосланы в Америку, в почтовые ящики сенаторов, эмигрантов, и прочих личностей, которые не равнодушны к делу Матковского. На вершине стопки красовался "Сибирский билль о правах", личные идеи Петлина, которые, по его мнению, привлекут американцев. Он задумался, а знает ли Матковский то, чего на самом деле он хочет?.\n\nПетлин покачал головой. Не было времени бездельничать.

Ещё никто в этом мире не получил право называть его так. Выдав неловкую, горькую улыбку в сторону Вонсяцкого, он и его телохранители направлялись на встречу с графом. Протянув свою руку, Матковский сказал:"Здравствуй, как там в Америке?"\n\nВонсяцкий не стал пожимать руку, но заместо этого наклонился вперед, чтобы попытаться обнять Матковского. Матковский сжалился. Америка изменила Вонсяцкого. Эти жесты, эта манера речи и приветские. Всё это от русского человека. Опьянёный духом, Вонсяцкий громко произносит:"Это страна свободы. Всё это, - показав рукой, - слишком мало для нас."\n\n"Ты видимо забыл причину, по которой ты здесь." Сказал холодным тоном Матковский.\n\n"Нет, нет." Он засунул руку в карман.

Однако, один корабль сильно выделялся своей металлической палубой и ржавыми деталями. Даже сильный ветер не смог пошатнуть его.\n\nМатковский следовал за своим помощником, державшим зонт, который защищал от ветра. Если Вонсяцкий говорил правду, то это именно его судно. Митчелл Уэрбелл, легендарный наёмник, ветеран тысячи войн по всему земному шару, волшебник шепчущей смерти. Матковский стал навстречу этому легендарному челому, прежде чем увидел фигуру, спотыкающуюся о ступени и падающую в его сторону.\n\nМатковский моргнул. Этой фигурой был Уэрбелл, немного зеленее, чем на фотографии и беретом, украшающим его голову. Матковсий ускорился так,что его помощнику было трудно угнаться за ним.

Он продолжил говорить на русском, смешивая его с английским, когда не понимал какие слова надо использовать. Матковский, в свою очередь, пытался отговорить его от уродования русского языка, иногда это получалось, но чаще всего эти слова проходили мимо его ушей.Его знания русского было мало и оно щедро поливалось такими фигурами речи как "fucking" и "shit".

Дверь надо было как-то открыть, но сломанный замок сделает только хуже. Может быть, понадобится топор. Он усмехнулся. Иван собирался выразить протест, несколько раз, на самом деле. Они могли просто попросить запасной ключ, но Дмитрий об этом не задумывался.\n\nЩелчок. Дмитрий встал и чуть не запрыгал от радости."Видишь?" Сказал он Ивану, который выдал некое подобие улыбки. Дмитрий пытается открыть дверь, но она не поддаётся."Чёрт возьми, закрыто изнути." В порыве ярости он пинает дверь. Иван постучал по его плечу, отводя его в сторону. Теперь у них есть топор.

Опасностью и не пахло, сибирские леса были наполнены тишиной, листва шелестела под потоками ветра, а воздух был как всегда холодным.\n\n"Думаешь Вождь позволит нам вернуться?" спросил Дмитрий у Ивана, который шел позади него, попутно осматривая окружности. Иван, покуривая сигарету, покачал головой. Иван знал свое дело или, по крайней мере, показывал, что не вляпался по уши. Рука, державшая сигарету, задрожала.

И тем не менее, поверхность этой штуки сияла от полировки - заметный американский манер приукрашивать дешёвые вещи так, чтобы те выглядели словно предметы роскоши.

Они, как всегда, играли патриотичные русские песни, а Сибирские охотники кое-как подпевали им и мычали мелодию, так как и приблизительно не знали слов. Вместо того, чтобы отключить полностью, ведущие просто сделали музыку потише к началу ток-шоу.\n\n"Добро пожаловать на Радио Свободный Магадан!"

Картридж вылетел с характерным звуком. Все пули были на месте.\n\nПока что, Олегу не приходилось использовать своё оружие на ком-либо. Ни медведей, ни леопардов рядом с ним не было, хоть он их и видел в лесах. Лисы, кролики и прочая живность была поймана с помощью ловушек. Стрельба по ним портит их вкус и, возможно, делает их опасными для употребления в пищу. Олег понял, что чтобы выжить, ему нужно быть не только сильным, но и сдержанным.\n\nОн поднял вылетевшую пулю и вставил её обратно в магазин. Настало время для ежедневного ритуала. Подготовившись, Олег начал разбирать своё оружие. Разложив детали на высушенной кроличьей шкуре, он начал тщательно их чистить водой из фляги. После очистки, он вытирал их о шкуру до сухости. Обледеневшими пальцами он собрал оружие. Чтобы узнать, есть ли неисправности, он вытащил магазин и нажал на спусковой крючок. Щелчок. Олег улыбнулся.

Пока что, при помощи водки, тряпья и бинтов, которые он нашел на трупе наёмника, Иван смог остановить кровотечение, кровь собиралась в темно-красные сгустки под белой оболочкой повязки.

Леса отказались показать путь к лагерю.\n\nНемного осталось, думал Иван, немного. Каждая ветка, каждый камень и каждая веточка и каждый бугорок привлекал его внимание, пока он замедлялся. Он был близок к обмороку. Он вытащил свой нож и попытался легонько ткнуть палец. Он переусердствовал и из-за паники порезался. Рана не была глубокой, достаточно, чтобы продолжать двигаться.

Их сняражение находилсь в плохом состоянии. Большинство солдат было экипированно практически неработающими винтовками, например, старыми моделями Арисаки и винтовками Мосина со времен Первой Мировой войны. Неплохой вариант для армии музейных восковых фигур, но совсем не то для желающих воевать. Как сказал Вождь (лидер русских) "Во имя спасения всей России".\n\nМы начали тренировку, как только прояснили ситуацию в РФП. И тут мы наткнулись на ещё одну проблему. Непотизм в рядах офицерах был настолько силён, что люди, которые никогда не держали винтовку в руках, могли обладать такими званиями как Лейтенант, Капитан и даже Майор. Как только мы указали Вождю на эту проблему, он согласился немедленно уволить этих людей. Так же он одобрил постройку нескольких офицерских школ, чтобы привести в форму офицерский состав.\n\nДоклады, которые мы получили с линий фронта, показывают хорошие результаты.

Смит (фамилия не предоставлена), к примеру, приехал из Южной Америки.

М16 на его спине была лучшим раздатчиком свинца в этой части России. Ополченты РФП не имели такого вооружения, им выдали старые М1 Гаранды, потому что они - не Смит. Поля, саванны, равнины и джунгли Африки показали свой след на его бронзовом загаре. У него были все права этого мира дерзить. Когда его приятели спрашивали его, почему стал наёмником, от отвечал: "Чтобы найти леди". Все, кто по настоящему понимал Смита, знали, что он занимался этим ради денег и войны.\n\nОн видед, как русские с завистью смотрят на его снаряжение. Смит лишь ухмылялся и подмигивал. Каждый раз, когда он курил, люди дивились над его чистыми, хорошо закрученными сигаретами. Иногда он предлагал кому-то закурить. Война - это бизнес, и бизнес процветал. Облокотившись на стену в случайной части захолустья, он доставал свои великолепные сигареты и закуривал.\n\nДля тихого и заброшенного города, Магадан был неплох. Не на уровне Блумфонтейна, конечно, но достаточно неплох. Однако, его сердце не принаджежит этому месту. Оно принадлежит местам западнее, на границе с царистами и лоялистами Родзаевского, под пулевым огнём и артиллерийскими обстрелами. Закурив, он выкинул сигарету и наступил на неё.

Matkovksy's generals and administration had taken upon itself to figure out some way to improve the true RFP's fighting ability. "The answer was simple", mused one senior officer. "When we realized we couldn't use conscripts, we bought soldiers from abroad instead". Indeed, mercenaries and military advisors, state-sponsored or otherwise, have been slowly but surely streaming into the frozen port of Magadan to not only pad Matkovsky's army of ill-suited conscripts, but to train them as well, to crack the whip and bring them, kicking and screaming, into the world of professionalism. The fat ones were now skinny, the malnourished ones healthy. All of them had a semblance of fighting spirit for the first time ever, and the guns, while still archaic, were at least cleaned and maintained properly. Training, as barebones as it was, actually began to prepare the conscripts and their mercenary counterparts for the realities of modern warfare in the frigid forests and marshes of Siberia. All this of course was tacked on to a very long and expensive bill that Matkovsky had to pass off to his administration. He was confident that there would be something for them to pay the mercenaries with.\n\nAfter Matkovsky's second inspection of the troops, which like the first, was kept as a surprise, he once again called a meeting with his general staff. As they filed in, worried that the inspection was not a good enough improvement from the original, many nervously fiddled with pens, or reports, others looking anywhere but to where Matkovsky stood. But as they all assembled, the Vozhd spoke. "After this second inspection", he said, in his normal, reserved manner, "I want to say good job, to all of you". Many were surprised. "I know that the task I assigned to you was not an easy one, and while we're far from perfect, I am pleased with the progress that we're making. The path to seek out mercenaries and foreign support was not one that I would have expected, but it's clearly working, and I will be meeting with some top advisors about how to increase the numbers and effects of these foreigners".

Tom thought for a moment, glancing over his shoulder back towards his crew and the sad cold dockyard they inhabited. For a split-second he prepared to shake the man off, then his posture relaxed and his resistance stopped. Why not be John Wayne for a while?\n\nThe two men eventually reached a bar, and Thomas Tremblay's newfound comrade Aleksandr kicked open the doors violently.\n\n"Brothers! Look at the American who has decided to come smuggling in our port! The one from the movies!"\n\nBlank faces stared back at the unfolding spectacle, seemingly annoyed at the disruption. Tom grinned, mustering a ham-fisted southern drawl.\n\n"Well, howdy folks!"\n\nThe room erupted into jovial cheers and laughter. Many, having been drunken into a stupor themselves indulged the fantasy. Others simply indulged in a good time. Tom was one such man, playing his part and chatting between beers for much of the night. Today had been a good day after all."

They had ransacked his shop. Trinkets lay in the ground, and what little cash they scrounged and wrung out of the trader's pockets laid themselves in the counter. The shop had seen better days. Days he could look to in fondness and warmth. The Union wasn't perfect, but at least they had not hired overgrown children to boss people around in Fascist uniforms.\n\nOne of the little Fascists, a stocky man with a voice frozen in permanent hysteria, thumped on the counter, sending the few coins on it into tremors. To his face, his fellow thugs called him Vlad, the Boss; behind him, they ridiculed his height and his voice and whispered rumors of him knowing some important figures in the Party's political wing. "I know that you've got some more," he said, "Come on, Bogdan," he plied with his hands folded together, "For our old friendship. You don't want to have all you ever had destroyed, do you? I am patient, but my friends here are not. I keep begging them, but they wouldn't leave you alone. I beg you, fulfill their simple wishes, and pay. I got your back from there."\n\nBogdan did not have anything else. Business had been slow since the fall of the Union, and chaos wasn't exactly great for commerce. He hung on to his shop with a kind of stubborn nostalgia. Perhaps the old times could return. He turned to his office, and said to his captors and tormentors: "Wait a moment." Kneeling beneath his desk, he found his family safe, which he promptly unlocked. A gun, and his late wife's jewelry. His hand inched towards the pistol, but he stopped mid-motion. Not today. Not wise. He took her wedding ring and pawned it off to Vlad.\n\n"I am so glad," Vlad said, "that you decided to relent. After all, you are one of our favorite customers.""

His printing press followed all of the Party's guidelines and regulations, and he lent them his business from time to time to print propaganda. However, in nights like these, with the moon nowhere in sight and accompanied by a single oil lamp, he let his facade slip and drop. He unscrewed his flask and drank some terrible vodka he had saved from the local distillery. Wretched stuff. But there was nothing better. The Party took the cream of the crop for themselves.\n\nHe returned to his desk, his figure throwing shadows in all directions. Sergei was in his office, his element. He considered lighting up a cigarette while he worked, but decided against it. Sitting down, he glanced at the pamphlets he had written, slightly satisfied at his own work. Soon, the "garbage collection detail" would come and collect his pieces, distributing them among the streets of Magadan. He paid them a small sum to hush about it.\n\nLeaning down, Sergei almost dozed off before a thought knocked on his skull. Why did he do this? Resistance to the Party was minuscule, and his men were more loyal to his money than anything else he could offer. He looked at his oil lamp, its fuel running low, a single candle-light holding out against a backdrop of darkness. The symbolism was not lost on Sergei. Perhaps in a few days, in a few weeks, maybe even a year, he would find himself in a basement, moments away from being snuffed out. He put aside his worries.\n\nA knock sounded.

Instead, it felt light, tasting of dirt. Horrible. He put it down, settling it behind his ankles.\n\nThomas stared at the image, a blurry mess of green blobs charging black dots on the screen. Today's movie was an adaptation of a famous American comic book, Captain America. For Thomas, a connoisseur supreme of the movie industry, this film was trash. Its projection and audio were even worse than the script. He had found out too late that the lenses didn't fit, and he had to prop it in with some tape. The result was a screen infested with a permanent blur, and the crackling, scarce, and incomplete audio made the viewing experience into something fantastical.\n\nMikhail Matkovsky - the Vozhd of the Russians, as he styled himself - sat at the front. A charismatic, almost intimidating man, it was almost comical to see him laughing at what Americans would think as garbage. Intelligence, it seemed, did not uplift taste.\n\nThe hero charged at the enemy, and the brown blots collapsed and tumbled backward. The crowd cheered, and the air was that of discordant revelry.

Today, perhaps, Nikita could earn a bit more than it needed for him to survive for another week. Maybe a pack of cigarettes, or even a can of powdered coffee. In his head, he toyed with the image of the Vozhd wearing something made from the lovely hide of this moose.\n\nAs usual, the RFP officials and thugs guarded every entrance to the city, their brown uniforms contrasting with the pale buildings of the town. However, Nikita noticed that the RFP now had new companions among its ranks. Sharply dressed men and women armed to the teeth and speaking a thousand foreign languages, congealing into a Tower of Babel manifested in the outskirts of Russia. It was quite the sight, with the mercenaries keeping to themselves and the Russians eternally suspicious of what was going on. The officials cleared him to enter the town, provided that he left his rifle in their checkpoint.\n\nThe hide sold for some good cash. Money he could use to buy bullets, provisions, food, and medical supplies to last him for another week. There was something new to the town, however: American products. American coffee, cigarettes, and even radio were available, and quite common even. They were cheaper than native-Magadan goods, although they were often sold out by the end of the day.

The gamble was over a couple of drinks and several hundred roubles, nothing big, but nothing small. They expected the night to go on as smoothly as before, a cruise into the moonlight as the games continue, pockets emptying, and men filing into the street with the grace of drunken feet.\n\nThree listless men enter into the bar, newly-arrived to the town of Magadan. They were WerBell's men, heavily armed and heartily paid: professional soldiers that hail from all corners of the world. They had too much free time. At first, they and the locals got along quite nicely. That is to say, they did not interact much at all - only silent nods and scarce eye contact bridged the difference between the group.\n\nThe uneasy truce did not last long. The listless men flirted with the girls behind the counter, and the locals did not like it. Standing up, they shouted profanities at the mercenaries, in a language they did not understand. It did not take long for the soldiers to unholster their pistols and threaten the locals. After about a minute, one of the mercenaries accidentally fired a shot, resulting in a dead civilian, only found hours later in the rioting that followed.\n\nThe locals, instead of being driven to fear by gunshots, charged the armed men, using broken bottles and chairs to take them down. WerBell's troops, dispatched as a backup for the new arrivals, got involved shortly. The Party's police, who intervened to stop more bloodshed, were met with a rain of bullets and jagged glass.\n\nA dozen civilians dead, with two dozen more wounded.

Now, as the sun was setting, its orange light aged his features beyond the man's already formidable years. He had joined the Party since its first days in Harbin, and was a veteran of the Anti-Bolshevik Front.\n\nPeople from inside the Party, further up in the hierarchy call her father Vlad the Tall, in mockery of his height. Outside the Party, they called him a thug, a criminal, a robber vested within an RFP uniform. Sometimes he could see the latter manifest itself when they met the neighbors. Small business owners, shopkeepers, and the fishermen of the port looked at him with a mix of fear, reprehension, and disgust. Any time any of them dared to cross Vlad's path, however, they scurried away almost immediately when he drew his gun, a trusty Nambu he had kept by his side for years, again, since the days of Harbin.\n\nIn Katerina's eyes, however, she did not find a monster in the figure of her father, standing as a single silhouette against the dying day.

Following Barbarossa and the Soviet Union's collapse, the CIA could scarcely glean any information from that vast country. Except for the West Russian War of the 50s, the Russia of our imagination had become a cesspool of violent infighting, with the German bombings preventing any attempts of regional warlords to consolidate power.\n\nAt least, this seems to be the case in West Russia and Siberia. With a land area that stretched from the Baltic to the Pacific, there are some stretches of territory untouched by the banditry and chaos that plagues the areas adjacent to the German Reich. From Central Siberia, the primary recipient of the Bukharin-era Siberian Plan, we have heard that a Republic had risen and collapsed there between the Second World War and the West Russian War.\n\nThen there is the Russian Far East - a region that the CIA has been observing for quite some time. In brief, the legitimate government of the Soviet Union (under the provisional leadership of Genrikh Yagoda) retreated there after their defeat; subsequently, the Anti-Bolshevik Front sprang out from Manchuria and Harbin, making significant gains before shattering into three parts based on Chita, Magadan, and Amur.\n\nIn particular interest of this briefing is the Free State of Magadan, led by Mikhail Matkovsky - a local fascist of some repute. He and his foreign minister, Nikolay Petlin, has promised reforms and democracy should the U.S. support their bid for the - as the Matkovsky insisted - "great crusade for Russia," as well as intelligence and information.\n\nThe Agency notes that the decision is the President's alone to make. However, it cautions the President in supporting any fascist bid for Russia. Moreover, the aforementioned minister, Petlin, seems to be a more malleable candidate for leadership. Whatever the President decides, the Agency shall carry out."

 magexp.1.t:0 "The Puppet Tsar"
 magexp.1.desc:0 ""Is the meal to your liking," Matkovsky said, as his hands cut another piece of beef, "Mr. Romanov?" Sitting across from him was the alleged Tsar, Mikhail. Candlelight illuminated those eyes that a few days ago had seen the muzzle-fire of rifles as the RFP stormed the "palace" where Mikhail ruled. The truth was, despite the regal garb and silverware elegant enough to act as a mirror, Mikhail was no more than a puppet for the old-style White Army types. While he waited for the response from this "Tsar," Matkovsky put his fork to his mouth, tasting the ragged, almost-done taste of the steak. Not good, not terrible.\n\nMikhail chewed, swallowed, and set down his utensils. Before he spoke, he wiped his mouth with a napkin. Taking up a glass of wine, he turned to regard Matkovsky, his gaze crisp and calm. "It was," Mikhail said, straightening to deliver his verdict, "an adequate dinner." Matkovsky smiled at him. From what he heard about the reluctant Tsar, Mikhail was never one to hold back his honesty. For all the legitimacy he lacked, Mikhail had one thing many in the Front did not have, from the monarchists to the fascists: a spine. He took a sip. Putting his glass down with a silent thud, Mikhail said, "Mr. Matkovsky, perhaps you will entertain a question from this humble prisoner."\n\n"Speak your mind," Matkovsky said, the dinner practically over at this point, "your "Majesty""."\n\n"I realize that my position in Russia has grown rather... tenuous." Mikhail gave himself a chuckle. "Not that it has been well in the first place, but there you go." Leaning back, an act of defiance against royal etiquette, he drew a deep, heavy sigh. "So, what'll happen to me now?"\n\nMatkovsky stared at him, deliberating. This "Tsar" was a potential danger. Mikhail could be a dangerous contender for power. On the other hand, the monarchist strain in the RFP was wearing away and fast. Soon, no one would take Mikhail's claim seriously, and letting him go into exile, far away from Russia, might be the prudent - and decent - decision. Matkovsky opened his mouth to speak."

As the Vozhd, he recognized that his work would never cease, but the heights! Oh, the heights that he had reached. From the underling of a madman into the head of the new Anti-Bolshevik Front. He snorted. Life was absurd; life was good.\n\nIn front of him was no alcohol, no whiskey, no vodka. He was drunk from another substance that had addicted him since the beginning of his career. Photo albums, in black and white, as well as in color, filled the surface of his desk. From the times of the old RFP in Harbin to the first incursion to Siberia, he had it all. Here he was, standing next to Rodzaevsky and Semyonov. There he was, inspecting the troops in the name of his old master, their black uniforms standing in contrast against a frozen background. He was young then. A true believer. A wry and sorrowful smile rose on his lips. If only men did not change. His mind wandered over the photographs, searching in vain for that turn in destiny that would perhaps have preserved their brotherhood. He found none.\n\nHe drew on his cigar again.

Petlin and Pavlov went up and down the piers, their silhouettes dark against the pale, weak morning light.\n\nA random thought struck him. They had not found WerBell's body. Try as he might, with his men spread out across the tundras and forests of Siberia, he could not find him. He sighed and breathed the scent of the sea. Wherever the mercenary was, he did not care. Dead or alive, WerBell was out of his way. He stepped forward and strode onto the docks.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomewhere in the world, a soft rock tune played in the background of a tropical cafe, overlooking a beach. A gruff, balding man sat in the corner, reading a newspaper, his cup of coffee untouched. He had to settle for cigarettes. He had fun in some exotic locale recently, and it was a crying shame that it ended. Fucking fascists. First they wouldn't pay, and now they kicked him out. What had the world come down to? He shook his head. No more honest employers these days, it seemed.\n\nHe put the papers down. For the first time since the morning, he tasted the coffee. Mud.

Surplus arms from the U.S. arsenals distributed among the soldiers have had an incredible effect, and the officer training has borne fruit. I can say without hesitation that the Vozhd's army is the most advanced in the Far Eastern territories; praise only checked by the old, military adage: they still have room to grow. The prospects of the Vozhd's "Crusade", - a term he insists on to no end - seems bright.\n\nContinuing from the last report, the RFP in Magadan has defeated their counterparts in Amur. Along with this development, they quickly broke the truce they had with the Tsarists in Chita and toppled the Tsar there. In one fell swoop, Matkovsky has succeeded in reunifying the old Anti-Bolshevik Front, albeit by force. Barring other emergent factions in the area, we are confident in saying that the Vozhd currently possesses the strongest forces in the East in terms of personnel and industrial capacity.\n\nHowever, we feel the need to qualify this series of rapid progress. There remains another significant force in the Far East: the Reds and the hardline RFP. The only main concern that the RFP and U.S. personnel note are the rumors from the Northern Siberia, of a religious leader amassing power among the tribes there. Though the probability of the RFP's victory remains high, we recommend further and closer inspection of regional developments. Mason out."

He laid his fingers on the lines that demarked the boundaries between the two mortal enemies. In the dark cold of his office, he could feel the heat rise to his touch, as decades of hatred and enmity burned in the frontlines.\n\nA thud. Petlin didn't mind it. It was probably an aide stumbling their way through the dark. He looked outside the windows of his little room. The night was bright, with momentary gaps of darkness, as the clouds conspired to keep the light of the full moon for themselves. In the coming days - he did not know when, maybe in a week or a month - would be the days of another confrontation. He sighed. If only there were another way. A knock on the door woke him up from his reverie.\n\n"Coffee, sir?" an aide said, bringing a tray full of the hot black liquid, steam rising from the cups, "I thought you wanted some, as I made some for the men."\n\n"Put it on my desk," he said, breathing a sigh of relief. At least, it wasn't the Vozhd, come to check up on his work. "Mind the map." The aide gingerly placed Petlin's cup on the northern edges of the map, its fragrant fumes spreading its way through the room. As he lifted the tray, however, he knocked it over, spilling the coffee. The aide hurriedly drew his handkerchief, but Petlin stopped him. The damage was already done. No amount of wiping would ever clean the map.\n\nThe aide withdrew from the room, profusely apologizing all the while. As Petlin examined the stain, however, he remembered the rumors from the north, of a heretic amassing his forces to free the Siberians from the tyranny of fascism and communism.

He had to be careful not to press the paper to harshly against the tree bark, or he would tear the fragile and thin piece of grey paper apart. The notes itself were simple, what he'd seen that day, the weather and geographical conditions, as well as the dispositions of the nearby locals.\n\nThe last part troubled Oleg more than any other. He did not like talking to people. He'd sooner crawl into the trenches of the enemy, evading mines and barbed wire, with machineguns raining fire upon him than talk to a bumpkin who couldn't even get their dialect right. Still, through the rugged surface, he managed to write a tiny bit of what he'd seen and heard of the locals. The data was probably insignificant, but he didn't care. He had done what was asked of him and done it brilliantly. He even talked to one or two of the less obnoxious farmers out there in the wilds. Finishing his writing, he shoved the paper into his pockets and sat down. It was time for a moment of rest. He took out a roughly rolled cigarette and lit it.\n\nIn the hands of the SIA, individual data was useless. Collectively, however, they might be the force that decided the battle. He dragged the cigarette out, letting the smoke cloud and cleanse his mind. After this, Oleg would go into the offices of the SIA and type up his report, drawing up conclusions and recommending courses of action for the higher-ups.

Occasionally they would come upon a bump on the road, and the four had to lift the blindfolded man back to his seat.\n\nTo their relief, the latter was silent. The voice that had proclaimed liberation for the workers of Russia from atop the radiowaves had held back, its will broken. He could do nothing now, his eyes shut, his hands tied behind his back - his followers lay dead in the fields, and whatever remained of his legacy would thaw like snow come the next spring.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, a random spot in the middle of Russia designated as the "execution point." Opening the cargo bed, they took the blind man and brought him out by the elbow, setting him down, gently as they can, to a patch of snow-covered soil. Then, they made him stand and walked him forward, to somewhere he did not know. An atheist all his life, he confessed that he regretted nothing, and the calm stillness of the dawn greeted the eerie silence of his heart. He did not need the opiate of the masses; his pain was his own.\n\nThey took the blindfold off him, and the sunlight shocked him. How many days had it been? How many months, years - how much time? They stopped, and he knelt. His eyes remained fixated on the sky above.\n\nThey read out his sentence. Rifles clacked, and all ends pointed to his head. "By order of the Vozhd of the Russians," a voice read out loud, somewhere in front of him, "I sentence you, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin," he was ready. "To exile!"

The sun hadn't yet set, but it was best to be ready when it did. His pen scribbled on the creamy, expensive paper that the Vozhd had brought for him, a generosity that matches the grandiose scale of his commission: the history of Christianity in the Far East. With each stroke, he struck the thought and the memory of how he came under the Mikhail Matkovsky's service, a story that he - and perhaps only he and only God - knew. He gritted his teeth, vowing to carry the tale to his grave. Each man bore a different cross, and this was his: not to die in honor but to live in shame.\n\nHis pen halted upon reaching the Fifties and the Sixties. Here, he sighed. For the sake of posterity, perhaps the future would do better not knowing the crimes done to reach a better age. Aside from the general chaos of Russia, he found himself stumped. Other than the obvious and apparent, there were no notable events that had happened in the Far East. He would have to consult his archives, documents, and books. Perhaps there he would be able to forge a narrative convincing enough, real enough, that there would be none who would question him. He opened the first book, a baptismal record, he had set on the table, and began reading, leafing through its pages to find and secure the desired truth.\n\nWithin the first few pages, the black bars started to appear. A certain Father, whose name was blotted out by thick, messy ink, had baptized hundreds in a village - the name blotted, struck out of living memory. Zakhar recognized his handiwork. He had to do it in a hurry. It had been a hard choice, but he cannot let the integral history of the monastery disappear. Zakhar remembered the Father, a man who undertook the difficult mission of proselytizing to the tribes in the north. Nobody thought that he would return, yet he did - bringing not peace but the sword. Zakhar rode out with him to the south, an aide in his war council, from the beginning, until the end.\n\nHe stepped outside, the weight of warm and bright memories twisted into darkness. The laughter, the tears, seemed to burn in his ears, a ringing sound that wouldn't cease. Then he saw the graves, their silhouettes dark against the dying sun. Rows upon rows, for miles upon miles. He saw the crosses of his comrades, men and women, that they bore in life, and that now they carry unto death. Crosses of rough-hewn wood, unmarked, and unnamed. He collapsed to his knees.

Yagoda himself had either died or disappeared; the Vozhd would not care for either. Preferably, the Vozhd would have had him shot - but fate did not will Matkovsky to do so. Dmitry nursed the stump that had once been his arm. He still felt it, at night, grasping at imaginary objects, gripping the handle of imagined doors, and brushing against walls that only belonged in his mind.\n\nIvan was out there, somewhere. The quiet bastard didn't even accept any form of thanks from him. A single grunt, and hands that shooed away any cigarettes, canned food, or money. Dmitry's prosthetic lay beside him, on the grass, its sockets yearning for an owner to wield them. Not now. It had been some time since the doctors amputated his gangrenous, infected arms in a dank, full medical tent. The morphine they provided had not been enough, and he still dreaded to think of the night.\n\nTurning to see the pile, he saw a guard in RFP uniform walk towards it carrying a can of petroleum. Others carried leaves, branches, and whatever flammable material they could find and smothered the pile with it. The heavy odor of petrol reeked as the guard first opened the can and then poured it on the papers, shuffling away from it, leaving a trail. Then he lit a match, and all of them watched as the fire caught the path fixed for it, and gently set the records ablaze.\n\nDmitry observed the flames burn with disinterest. What had transpired between the Vozhd of the Russians and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, he did not care. He felt the flames brush his face, its heat intensifying by every second. He sat, messaging his stump, and watched the past crumble to ashes before his eyes."

 magexp.11.desc:0 "Petlin watched as Matkovsky and the rest of his Cabinet took their seats at the round table on the highest floor of the RFP building. He followed them, sitting right beside Matkovsky, a mere ambassador lifted to the position of the right-hand man. He was the lifeline between the Americans and the Party, after all. A chandelier set the room alight, an unfamiliar sight to Petlin's eyes. The Cabinet usually met during the day, not at night.\n\nOnce they were all seated, Matkovsky turned to him, mouthing, "That all of them?" He gave the Vozhd a nod, who then stood up and coughed, silencing the whispering that had commenced among the ministers. "Gentlemen," Matkovsky said, "I come to you here today with a bold proposal," he tapped his fingers on the table, going around the table, counter-clockwise. "As per the recommendations from our dear friend Nikolay Petlin," he pointed at Petlin as if his point needed clarification, "who has proposed a radical change: a change that would change, perhaps the very nature of the party." Arriving at the other end of the table, he stopped, before continuing, "I understand that many of us here, including me, Petlin, Pavlov, and many others have served the cause of Russia ever since the creation of the Party in Harbin." Striding forward, he raised his voice, "However, the times have changed. The Party needs, forgive me for the trite expression, move on with the times."\n\nReturning to his former seat, he said, "I propose to do away with the affectations of the past. To..." his voice trailed away, before once again finding purchase, "escape the shadow of Rodzaevsky." He raised his head and looked at every man seated in their eyes, "We shall sign the charter of Magadan. Petlin, our dear friend," his hands grasped Petlin's shoulders, "has kindly written a new constitution for us." He let go, before clapping his hands together, "I am sure that all of you have read it. Now, I propose, that from today henceforth the Russian Fascist Party is no more - it is now the National Labor Party of Russia." He paused, gauging every man there for their worth, "All in favor say aye."\n\nThere was no dissent."

Your Vozhd is calling you to a higher purpose! Though you may not have helped vanquish the false heirs to Harbin, you now have the opportunity to achieve a far greater glory: The reunification of our Russian land! Our friends in America have sent you the finest arms and equipment, but now we need you!"\n\nSergey pondered these words as he went downstairs to eat his breakfast. His parents had made him a simple kasha, and as he ate he could hear the truck driving by again.\n\n"Our victory over the traitors, subversives and lunatics is the first step towards a triumph over the Hun! With your help, we shall celebrate New Year's in Moscow! With your help, we shall celebrate Christmas in Kiev! And with your help, the world will stand in awe of Russia's majesty once more! Enlist with the National Republican Army today, and our Motherland will be united tomorrow!\n\nSergey knew his parents wouldn't approve, but after his breakfast he hurried to city hall to find the local recruiter.

Mikhail had painted over all of their troublesome antics with a single big, red brush. Yes, the far eastern reaches were secured, but it would not be enough.\n\nIt would never be enough. Magadan had been a poor home for the emigrees who had fled there, hoping for a new place. A new home. A new Russia. And now, a step had been taken towards this new dream. To think it was all coming within his grasp...\n\nOf course, he still had work to do. Control had to be solidifed, the Americans had to be sated, and the future had to be secured. But - his dream kept coming back to him. A free russia, different than all that had come before it. A new place, where everything was better. Everything was calmer. A place Russians could truly call home - no matter the price that would come in making it.\n\nA new, hopeful land. Peace through order; order through strength. This was the maxim they needed. Strong. Firm. Uncompromising.\n\nAnd despite all his glances to the forms on his desk, he couldn't get over the thoughts dancing in his head."

 magreg.3.desc:0 "Control information and you can sway the people, many say. What better way than to influence the radio? Several of Matkovsky's advisors have urged him to take a direct approach to the Radio Free Magadan, such as the Laborists who wish to use it for propaganda.

Mikhail strutted in accepting the greetings of a few Laborists, the glances of several Reformists, and - the silence of the room largely. It was quiet today. A small miracle - not having to deal with the bickerings of his own party. Nikolay Petlin came to the podium, and Mikhail waited to hear what was first on the agenda.\n\n"The first order of business on the agenda; the arrest of Mikhail Matkovsky." Nikolay stated calmly, with a single bit of iron to his tone.\n\nThe Vozhd froze, and then blinked. Had he heard that right? Arrest? Him? For a moment, he assumed it was a joke. A single bit of dry humor from a man who wanted his position. However, no one in the party protested. No one in the party laughed, or raised their voice. The Laborists he had greeted just minutes ago turned pale, and the room remained utterly silent.\n\n"For numerous crimes against both Russia, and the Russian people..." Nikolay continued, but Mikhail was no longer listening. How could this have happened? How did this happen? It wasn't possible. It wasn't. But as he stood there with a dumbfounded expression, shock written across his face, the guards moved. Not to arrest Petlin, or to shoot him on the spot.\n\n"Traitor." The former Vozhd whispered once quietly, as the guards moved to restrain him. "TRAITOR! YOU - BASTARD! You and your Reformers, every last one of you a bastard! You can't - " Arms wrapped around his own. Rage, fear, and sorrow compressed into a single scream.\n\nNone of his own clique look at him as he's dragged away. The guards ignore his pleas. And Nikolay Petlin, his spineless foreign minister, his subordinate, his replacement looks him in the eye the entire time he's dragged out."

 magreg.5.desc:0 "Petlin sat, metaphorically and physically, on the edge of his seat in a leather armchair in his study. He had already heard the doors slamming, the engines roaring like hellhounds off to drag him down to his final judgement, and the boots of soldiers slamming the ground as they made their way up his driveway. He knew what was coming, he had for weeks. Between the ominous looks from laborists, his allies disappearing, and the Vozhd's stranglehold growing ever tighter, Petlin knew a reckoning was coming. The death of any hope of freedom in Magadan was at hand. Yet, despite how much he had prepared himself mentally, the event still shook the man to his core.\n\nPetlin heard downstairs his door coming off its hinges unceremoniously as Matkovsky's thugs stormed his home. He stood up, awaiting the three armed men rushing up his staircase and into his study. As he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, suddenly his breath was stolen from him as the primed-for-combat soldier at the front tackled him at the waist. Dizzy and in pain, Petlin was rolled onto his back and shackles were snapped onto his wrists as his charges were read out.\n\nTreason. A believable charge, an expected charge. It still stung to hear that all his efforts to improve his country had earned him the title of traitor.\n\nThe traitor was dragged out into the street. His neighbours stayed indoors so as to not incur the wrath of the Vozhd. Instead, they watched through their blinds as Petlin was thrown into the back of an unmarked truck. It sped off down the street, never to return to this place. Through his blistering headache, Petlin had only one thought."

When he asked about the men they stole them from, one sailor callously described a brief firefight, but Abramov could see through his drunken state it was not as pleasant as he described.\n\nMatkovsky's forces may have lacked the aging Vozhd's legitimacy, but they were practical men and women; cutthroats. He thought back to his time with Rodzaevsky, watching as the RFP split and the old man ranted about Japanese help. Japanese?! No ture Russian would bow to a tea-drinking emperor who sat upon his silk pillows far away; the Revolution had proved that.\n\nTurning back to the shore, he saw the new banners of Matkovsky's RFP raised high, though as smugglers, such overt recognition would not help.

For as much as the people of Siberia are united in strength, all of Russia must be ours to defeat the German and Japanese imperialists!

Although the flow of immigrants has come to a near halt since the collapse of the Soviets, the occasional Red Navy ship will come to our shores, usually with diplomats, smugglers, and leaders from whatever warlord can call himself a "state". Most of them have ended up in local jails before release, but reports from the Russian communities across Oregon and California are describing a coordinated campaign.\n\nThe Siberian National Republic is one of the few places the United States has contact with, and an increasing number of "emissaries" and "ambassadors" to cultural groups, most of which are grumbling veterans talking of returning to their homes and fighting in Siberia. Federal agents undercover in these groups have not found any mentions of domestic attacks, but instead encouraging these families to return to Siberia as settlers, not as terrorists.

And the work Roman had to do to secure himself and his wife a boat to America was better left blocked off in his mind.\n\nHe had made himself a new man in California. He paid off his dues, he could speak English with only a trace accent, and his two sons were American schoolboys! What was left in Russia besides despair and broken faith?\n\nThat was until the Siberian talked with him and Lena after church. He did not ask them to be indentured, nor to rob stores for his cause. He handed him a document, a promise to join the Siberian National Republic, a promise to right the wrongs of the Germans a thousand times over. He had briefly mentioned it with Lena; she was eager to go, already requesting to withdraw the boys from school.\n\nHe thought it absurd until the memories came again. The smoke and the bombs, the world he was forced to leave behind by incompotent men beyond his reach. He might not live to see his hometown again, but he would make sure his descendants would. The Peshkovs had lived for centuries in Russia, and he would not break with tradition."

The two young boys who clutched their parents sides looked up at him in fear, the worst these two probably had ever seen was a schoolyard bully. They would learn how to live up here, eventually.\n\nAfter they signed their names, the family was brought into an old indoor gym, along with the rest of the émigrés.

American police were beginning to worry, but the Siberian National Republic's smugglers were second to none in the Pacific.\n\nMost of the new arrivals had at least one valuable skill, and so they were put to work fixing up much of the empty buildings. Some began to work with Matkovsky and form actual amenities - Magadan now had a fire-fighting brigade. For those less suited to life in Siberia, Magadan's soldiers would provide basic training. Every man and woman needed to do their duty.\n\nAnd as expected for today, the similar dots of old Red Navy ships moved to the shore, the tides carrying evermore American Russians eager to take back their homeland."

The thought certainly lingered in his mind, but Mikhail had enough friends in the Russian neighborhoods across the United States to keep him hidden if need be.\n\nThis was a test of the Americans and their responsiveness. Before they had rarely considered working in the Russian anarchy, and a chance to secure the help of the OFN, even if they were corrupt oligarchs, would be a boon to his legitimacy. Some shipments of guns wouldn't hurt either.\n\nHe entered the car and watched the gray landscape pass by as his chauffeur worked down to the docks. Unfortunately, the journey would have to be by sea. The crew may have been manned by the most loyal members of the RFP, and the ship was the best one his smuggler fleet had, but it would still be a treacherous ride."

We are told in Siberia that the battles are tough and the winters are cold, but with American guns and fuel their troubles are sure to be few.

Whether it is scrounging up what we can from the pillaged resources of our neighbors, or increasing the appeal of illegal shipping to the Port of Magadan, we must work tirelessly from the ground up.\n\nIn this Russia, crazed with pain, we are once again forced to resort to using smuggled goods and arms from Western and Japanese markets to prop up our republic. Faced by enemies from all sides, our failure to secure American support in our struggle against warlordism and the Siberian wilderness are telling of how truly alone we are in our fight for supremacy in this corner of the world.\n\nWith a firm resolve to improve our misfortune, the Vozhd turns his eyes to other markets, local and international, to attract the flow of arms and supplies to our domain.

With a kick-started economy and an army fit to fight, the Siberian National Republic can stand on it's two feet and fight the chaos of anarchy with the support of her international allies.

Following the party congress, several groups within the RNLP have begun to branch off as factionalism grows. Among them are the three most politically relevant: The Old Guard, Laborists, and Reformists. Under Matkovsky, the Laborists advocate for the Vozhd's policies. The Reformists, meanwhile, seek just that- reform (as well as a helping hand from the OFN), with officials in their higher echelons including Petlin himself. Lastly, the Old Guard; mostly, they are remnants of older fascists, living in faded glory as an extreme alternative to cast a more favorable shadow over the Laborists."
 magreg.26.a:0 "A battle for the ages!"
 
 magreg.27.t:0 "The Grand Sobor"
 magreg.27.desc:0 "Within his office in Magadan, Nikolay Petlin allowed himself a small smile. For the first time in years he could reasonably say that he was hopeful for the future. After months of careful maneuvering he had convinced Matkovsky to allow a primitive legislative body to be formed. The Grand Sobor was barely worth the name, but it was a start.\n\nThe Vozhd was still the ultimate power in Magadan, as he was not about to give up more than token influence over the nation. In fact, getting Matkovsky to relinquish even what little power that was given to the sobor was almost miraculous in and of itself, but even so a victory had been scored for the people of Russia, as minor as it was.\n\nIt was clear to Petlin that Matkovsky thought the matter closed, that the token reforms he had allowed would be the end of the discussion. He believed he could simply go back to closing his mailed fist ever tighter around the Russian people, but Nikolay knew in his heart that he had only just begun. The Russian people had suffered for so long and they deserve so much more than a council that would rubber-stamp Vozhd Matkovsky 's decrees. It would be difficult, and very dangerous, but he would do all he could to bring about a Russia that its people could be proud of."
 magreg.27.a:0 "The one step at a time."

 magreg.28.t:0 "By the Will of the Vozhd"
 magreg.28.desc:0 "It appears that the party congress was the last vaguely democratic breath of Magadan, as today the Vozhd has quelled any shred of a doubt that there will be a council or congress. The power is his and his alone. Officials among the Reformists grow deeply worried, and so too have the Labourists. Not out of fear that the Vozhd has overstepped his bounds, but instead that Petlin and his compatriots would see the blatant seizure of power as a direct attack on their goals and they would begin undermining the party."
 magreg.28.a:0 "Troubling development for both sides, it seems."

 magreg.29.t:0 "No Longer Free"
 magreg.29.desc:0 "Smoothly and carefully, power over information has been successfully consolidated. With the Laborists getting their way, the old hosts of RFM rot in prison on charges of treason. Now, loyal subjects bring the news, the laughter, and the love to the people of Magadan. Loyalty, after all, is stronger than freedom."

Important information on the recent string of arrests, the weather, and more at 11:00. After all, you're not gonna hear more about the former anywhere else. RFM, your source for Laborist-bias free news!"
 magreg.30.a:0 "Back to our scheduled programming."

 magreg.31.t:0 "A Brief Glimpse of Daylight"
 magreg.31.desc:0 "Nikolay Petlin scraped his fork across the plate for about the fifth time since the last bit of meat had been picked clean. Embroiled in thought, he continued to swirl the bits of sauce and grease that remained as his mind wandered. The taint of fascism was running deeper and deeper in Magadan with every passing days, stretching its tendrils across his fair country and tightening its grip. There was an anger there, for sure, but there was also optimism coupled with the tug of despair. It was his duty to rid what was once a protective measure, now a vile curse, from Harbin and Russia at large. Just as he was about to scrape the plate once again, he heard his wife pipe up from across the table.\n\n"It will work out. I have trust in you." Spoke Lydia, already knowing what was tearing at her husband. It taunted her too, in fact, every facet of Magadan reeked of the RFP and, by extension, her late ex-husband Rodzaevsky.\n\n"Will it? There is so much work to be done, Lydia. Matkovsky rules like a butcher and every day it seems like freedom gets further away and fascism gets stronger." Replied Nikolay.\n\n"Someone has to do it, Nikolay. Gladly, that person is you, but you don't have to do it alone. I know these types, hell I was married to one. They're strongmen. Matkovsky is a man who rules by fear and brutality. A force of freedom will always topple a paper tiger like him."\n\n"Thank you." Nodded Nikolay. The burden was not entirely eased, but at least he had some measure of reassurance. But moreso, he simply wanted out of the conversation. So, with a stiff upper lip he picked up his plate and placed it in the sink before heading off to his study, his mind abuzz with the same witch's brew of emotions."
 magreg.31.a:0 "A drop of hope still goes a long way, though."

 magreg.32.t:0 "A New Beginning"
 magreg.32.desc:0 "For Nikolay Petlin, the last few days had been a whirlwind of confusion and danger. The tyrant Matkovsky was in chains, arrested in a moment of weakness by a man he had thought so below him to be more a bug than a man. Petlin's supporters held the former Vozhd in a secure cell within Magadan, under close guard. It was almost enough to make him laugh, the sheer luck that had been necessary for the success of the coup boggled the mind.\n\nHis co-conspirators had risked it all to overthrow the Tyrant, and had Matkovsky been, ironically, more like his hated rival Rodzaevsky he would have likely ended Petlin's rebellion before it had begun. Thankfully, his arrogance had blinded him to the threat brewing under his nose. Now, a similar trouble brewed even as he sat overlooking the city.\n\nIn the depths of his new office, Petlin found himself in a very precarious position. While Matkovsky was safely behind bars, support for the Tyrant of Magadan was high in the Army and the Security Service. It would be a perilous task in and of itself to prevent Matkovsky's supporters from retaking control of the government, but it would be a necessary one. For the people of Russia to prosper, Matkovsky's tyranny needs to be left in the dustbin of history."

 magreg.33.t:0 "Last Gasp of Freedom"
 magreg.33.desc:0 "Something is occurring in Magadan. The citizens ignore it, trying their best to go about their daily business like these people never existed while the politicians fight over it in hushed whispers of backrooms. People are disappearing left and right, picked out of their homes in the night and rushed off to Laborist prison camps. Noticeably, most of them have been reformists. Only the Vozhd truly knows what's going on. Petlin was inches away from undermining his power, but Matkovsky had been too arrogant to acknowledge the threat.\n\nAs seen by the recent arrests, however, this will not happen again under the Vozhd's watch. Stability is the key to preserving power, and if that takes a purge, so be it."
 magreg.33.a:0 "None will be spared."

 magreg.34.t:0 "Petlin at Sea"
 magreg.34.desc:0 "Nikolay Petlin was never a fan of sea travel. The sheer emptiness of the ocean made even the Siberian forests feel comforting. But this journey was too important to waste fearing a watery grave. Petlin was to go to America for business.\n\nGathering up the contents of the briefcase, he looked forward to the mission. The Siberian National Republic needed American aid if it was to be anything more than another warlord in the mix. Considering how Rodzaevsky was moving to do the same with the Japanese, it would more likely turn Washington to his side.\n\nHe headed down the ship into his quarters; comfortable by warship standards, but not by much else. The engines began to whir as he, his aides, and his ship, set off to the West Coast."

 #Petlin
 petlin.1.t:0 "The New Republic"
 petlin.1.desc:0 "Petlin adjusted his glasses as he entered Matkovsky's office, in the old RFP headquarters in Magadan. The place definitely seemed lived in. Shot-glasses with neat whiskey in them, and bottles of vodka just gathering dust littered the desk where the former Vozhd had once sat. Matkovsky likely knew that he was being arrested, and prepared himself accordingly. Petlin just did not expect him to indulge in alcohol, in the twilight hours of his political career. Outside, the wind howled, pounding the window-panes with savage force. Petlin wanted to shiver, but he was not cold.\n\nHe remembered the sight of Matkovsky as the guards hauled him away to prison, awaiting trial. A pale face, a pair of bloodshot eyes, and a face that screamed utter defeat. Once, he had believed that Matkovsky was somewhat of a good man: standing up against the blackshirts and the savage barbarity that was commonplace in Harbin were virtuous deeds. When Petlin proposed the Siberian Bill of Rights, the old Vozhd seemed excited at the prospect of a renewed gesture at political reform. However, right in this office, a few years ago, he remembered as Matkovsky tore at his bill, decrying his ideals as "too liberal." Then came the Dalstroy scandal. Matkovsky was a monster all along.\n\n"No more Harbin," Petlin said, to Matkovsky. "No more the atrocities, no more the ideologies that debase us to the level of beasts." He strode to Matkovsky's favorite gramophone and turned it on. March of Siberian Riflemen filled the air. He picked up an empty shot glass and toasted to comrades long gone."
 petlin.1.a:0 ""To the memories of Harbin.""

 petlin.2.t:0 "Hope for Siberia?"
 petlin.2.desc:0 "Promising reports have reached the CIA from our contacts in the Siberian National Republic. A new government has usurped power from Mikhail Matkovsky's regime, and seems to bear all the signs of a functioning democracy in the making. This new government, headed by one Nikolay Petlin, also seems quite interested in strengthening ties with the US. Requests of that nature from Petlin's government have already reached the State Department, and await our response."
 petlin.2.a:0 "We could always use new friends."

 petlin.3.t:0 "Word from Washington"
 petlin.3.desc:0 "It seems our efforts to strengthen ties with the United States have borne fruit. Our foreign office has received word from American diplomats that they are interested in increasing economic and diplomatic relations between our two nations. All that remains now is to sort out the details, but that shouldn't be too much of a challenge for the Foreign Ministry. This could be the start of a beautiful relationship indeed!"
 petlin.3.a:0 "Wonderful."

 petlin.4.t:0 "Exorcising the Shadow"
 petlin.4.desc:0 ""This is ridiculous, Petlin!" Alexander Pavlov said to him in his office, "the Voz- Matkovsky might have been a criminal, but to abolish his title is a betrayal to our cause." Pavlov sighed. "Let's walk back on this, Petlin, my friend. We must safeguard the legacy of our predecessors. Matkovsky was a good man, and without him, the Party would not have reached Siberia. He was a criminal, yes, but all he did, he did for the glory of his motherland."\n\n"I believe you, Pavlov," Petlin replied, his voice calm. "However, comrade, without Matkovsky the Dalstroy would not exist as an entity. The papers," Petlin was exasperated. "The papers in the Irkutsk Presidium. Remember that? The paper trails he'd burnt to cover his trace. The Soviets might not be our allies but their insight is important. Matkovsky is a criminal, and I will see him tried. No trace of his influence shall remain in this - in my - party. I hope you understand."\n\n"Fine. if you would not recognize his existence, then I will not recognize your government." He pointed at Petlin. "Listen, Petlin. I never liked you much in the old days, but now, there is no reason to hold back. You are not my Vozhd, Nikolay Petlin, and I will make sure the Laborists know that. The SIA, too." He stormed out the door.\n\nPetlin was tempted to call out to him, using the American expression. What was it again?"
 petlin.4.a:0 ""Don't let the door hit your ass on your way out.""

 petlin.5.t:0 "Criminals No Longer"
 petlin.5.desc:0 "The bare feeling of legs without shackles was new to Ivanov. The Dalstroy had put him to work digging railways and pointless public works for his association with the NKVD. He toiled, day and night, under starvation rations, sure that he would collapse at any given moment. His body was weak, and the work certainly did him no favors. Ivanov looked at his shoulders and arms. Boney, without much substance nor muscle. The soup they ladled out, thin and unappetizing, did not provide for much sustenance.\n\nThen, armed guards of the Siberian National Republic strode into the camp, arresting everyone. Some of the wardens ran to the woods, after a gunfight with the army. Ivanov heard that the rogue guards had been detained, awaiting trial, same as with their Vozhd. The act startled him. Justice in the depths of the Russian Far East was not unlikely; it was impossible. Yet, there he was, the soldiers casting off his shackles and delivered him away from that hell.\n\nNow, his only concern was that he needed a job. However, surely, President Petlin and his Prime Minister would take care of that. No more shadows, no more domination by powers that only sought power."
 petlin.5.a:0 "Only Justice."

 petlin.6.t:0 "Memories of Harbin"
 petlin.6.desc:0 "The scene was perhaps familiar. Petlin remembered the evenings and nights in Harbin, as the Russian Fascist Party celebrated its zenith. The swastika, the hooked cross ran through by electrified lights, shone like a Christmas tree in the freezing winds of Harbin winters. Yet, they stood, neither fire nor flames warming their hearts, but through the strength of will alone. Love, too.\n\nLove, the strongest of all emotions. It was love that brought them into Russia again. It was love that made them think of Russia when the Japanese and Chinese ignored and discriminated against them. Yet, it was love that also begat Rodzaevsky's obsession with a pure Russia, that justified the Dalstroy's atrocities. As Petlin and the people of Magadan held the candles in the remembrance of such tragedies and feats of will, they closed their eyes and prayed. A choir song soft hymns to God, of forgiveness and repentance. Petlin closed his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his own past. An organizer, of voices that once spoke of him with warmth and looked out for him. Of Matkovsky, of Rodzaevsky - they were young then, and all so foolish. So, so foolish. When he opened them, the patriarch led the flock through the Lord's prayer. Petlin followed."
 petlin.6.a:0 ""And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.""

 petlin.7.t:0 "Goodbyes"
 petlin.7.desc:0 ""Well, Lydia," Petlin said, at the entrance hall to his house, addressing his wife. "I'm off, and maybe for some time. It's going to be a few days, weeks, I don't know. I promise you that I'll be back soon." He regarded his wife with a broad smile on his face. Petlin was proud of her. A dissident in her own right, a powerful and active woman, freed from the clutches of Rodzaevsky the madman. He shuddered to think of what the deranged Vozhd had done to her, but she did not tell of her days in Harbin much.\n\n"See you, dear." Lydia said as she corrected her husband's tie. "Where are you going again? I have been on Magadan for so long that I don't know much about Russia."\n\n"Novosibirsk. The city of the Sun, as they call it, dear. I know that I will be far from you, but this is necessary. Soon, you will leave Magadan, and we shall go westwards. The state cannot hold a government from such a remote position such as Magadan."\n\n"I liked it here, at least."\n\n"I know. We will return here someday when Russia is whole again. Perhaps we'll even cross the straits, into America. See Los Angeles, San Francisco! Maybe even Vegas."\n\nShe smiled, a twinkle of enthusiasm in her eyes."
 petlin.7.a:0 ""It's a promise, dear.""

 petlin.8.t:0 "The Assembly of Novosibirsk"
 petlin.8.desc:0 "The conference at Novosibirsk took place behind closed doors, within the old halls of the city's local presidium. Whatever media that Russia had, as well as some foreign outlets from America, trailed the proceedings. All deputies of the Russian National Party refused to comment. Petlin hurried away on his car before the reporters could reach him, bodyguards shoving the crowds away from him. Whatever that could be gleaned from the discussions within seemed to speak in favor of reformism, although no one knew its details.\n\nFinally, on one crisp morning, Petlin stepped out on a podium, the rest of the Russian National Party behind him. "People of Russia and Siberia," he began, gathering his strength to address a nation. Or half of it. "I stand before you today, the leader of the Siberian National Republic, its president by the will of arms." He paused. "But that will be no longer. I declare thusly: that political parties are now legal, that the government will now seek approval from its people. We dedicate ourselves to the restoration of a democratic, and republican Russia." All eyes were on him. "That is all."\n\nCheering broke out as he turned his back to face his party. In the middle of cold Siberia was a small spring of warmth. The media did not know of it, but Petlin smiled at their enthusiasm."
 petlin.8.a:0 "The Siberian thaw has begun."

 petlin.9.t:0 "The Siberian Constitution"
 petlin.9.desc:0 "After his declaration at the end of the Assembly of Novosibirsk, Petlin had gathered independents, laborists, and his own wing of the party together to discuss the specifics of a new constitution to replace the old Bill of Rights. In this, Petlin added provisions that defended the rights of free speech, assembly, and the right to organize politically. The laborists grumbled and complained, but they did not have sole power on the party anymore. The independents, at first wary of Matkovsky, soon warmed up to him. Finally, after years of dictatorial rule, a leader who would listen to their concerns.\n\nStanding in the halls of the Novosibirsk Assembly, Petlin remained the previous years, standing before Matkovsky as the presented his idea of a Bill of Rights before the Vozhd. "Too liberal." The words came back to him. "I am suspecting that you are a socialist, Petlin." He gave a chuckle. How was he so weak? If the same Vozhd returned to him, clad in his full glory, Petlin would not submit. The peoples of Russia have their rights, and he shall not deny them their entitlement. He swore that no one shall experience what had happened in Harbin, ever again.\n\nA couple of Siberian deputies approached him, hammer-and-sickle pins on their suits. Petlin became weary, but then they invited him to dinner. He smiled. Perhaps the communists are not as bad as they say, after all."
 petlin.9.a:0 "A new democracy is born."

 petlin.10.t:0 "Enemy, Mentor, Protégé, President"
 petlin.10.desc:0 ""Do you visit me just to gloat, Petlin?" Matkovsky shot him a venomous look. "When I am dying, you come to me. Foreign Minister, Deputy, protégé, but above all, a traitor to our ideals. A traitor to Harbin!" Matkovsky rose from his bed but collapsed right back into it. When Petlin moved to help him, he held his hand out. "I do not need a traitor's help." He coughed blood. "I am close to dying, and I see my vision for Russia burning before my eyes. Its arsonist stands before me, yet I can do nothing."\n\n"Matkovsky," the name sounded strange on Petlin's tongue. "Would those that stand for the memories of Harbin let the pressure heaved upon us against our own people? If a decent man sees the Dalstroy and condemns it not, would it make him true to the memories of labor in Harbin, where women sold themselves on the streets, out of desperation? Tell me that," he held his breath. "Vozhd of all Russians."\n\n"You have no right to address me as such! You lowly worm, lowest of the low. To say that I despise you would be an understatement, Petlin."\n\n"The feeling is mutual, Matkovsky." They stared at each other, too angry to continue the conversation. "Trust me with Russia. I will take care of her well."\n\nA light of sympathy burned in Matkovsky's eyes. "Perhaps. Petlin, if you do not succeed. I will torment you in Hell. Remember that. Now, leave me, Mr. President.""
 petlin.10.a:0 "Mentor and protégé reconciled within one common wish."

 #Matkovsky
 matkovsky.1.t:0 "A New, Winter Dawn"
 matkovsky.1.desc:0 "Matkovsky had been here before, in the misty days where Magadan constituted his only territory. His office was cleaner, his vodka more expensive, and the stationary both more reliable and better to grip. Yet, the old Harbin feeling never left him. He looked at the window, seeing petals of snow unfurl and split in mid-air, the howling of the winter winds dying against the glass-panes. Some flakes stuck, but they slid down, leaving a trail of clear liquid behind them.\n\nHe turned his attention to the list. Sheets upon sheets of names, blotted out in the order of their execution. At the top of the list was his enemy: Nikolai Petlin. The name was crossed out, but in truth, Matkovsky did not know where he went. Still, it was preferable to keep his absence in a more permanent state. Nikolai Petlin was dead, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAides came and went by his room, carrying a chill with them, shivering as they handed out reports of the purge to the Vozhd. "Hey," Matkovsky said to a lanky, blond aide. "Turn that gramophone on." The roar of music and the howl of the winds masked the gunshots, out in the Siberian wilds."
 matkovsky.1.a:0 "A Vozhd's work never ceases."
 
 matkovsky.2.t:0 "A Siberian Bill, Renewed"
 matkovsky.2.desc:0 "Once upon a time, the Vozhd of the Russians entrusted his loyal follower to write a constitution for him. The minister in charge was Nikolai Petlin: the traitor, the man responsible for the poisonous current of liberalism that ran in the Vozhd's party. His venom corroded Matkovsky's hold, like venom hissing upon contact with steel. The Vozhd was a merciful man, full of lenience. Yet, he could never let this sort of thing occur ever again. Not the least when he was this close to power.\n\nSo, he would have to be strict. He had entrusted the Russian before with the powers of political liberties and free speech, yet, they betrayed him. Tonight, by himself and a candle-lit room, Matkovsky would bind together a Siberian Bill of Rights. A new one, with none of the flaws of the old. He had to. If the Russian people and dissidents of the Party would defy him, he found no better alternative than self-defense.\n\nHe would start by cutting. The former Bill of Rights was too long, too wordy, too ponderous. It spent a lot of its length clarifying useless liberties that could threaten the Party's position. Matkovsky did away with them striking provision after provision with slashes from his pen.\n\nWhen morning light spilled from the windows to his desk, he rose, a new Bill in his hand. The Vozhd smiled, his work done."
 matkovsky.2.a:0 "Never shall the mistake be repeated."
 
 matkovsky.3.t:0 "Voter Rolls"
 matkovsky.3.desc:0 "When his village announced the new voting rolls for his district, Aysen was excited. Perhaps the Vozhd of the Russians would not be the leader of Russians alone. Yet, he, with the rest of the Sakha people living there, found their names absent from the board. Aysen's eyes looked over the A section, over and over again, sure that there was a mistake. It was blank as if the local officials had skipped over him.\n\nSo, this day, he came to the offices of the electoral commission, seeking to complain. Aysen was rightfully a citizen of the state, and he would not see his rights violated. Inside the log-built wooden building was a burly man who attended a thin slab of plank for a table. Two guards, armed with rifles and pistols, stood on the opposite corners of the room. A door was at the back, leading further into the innards of the office. Approaching the man, Aysen said, "Sir, I am sorry for interrupting your work, but my name is not on the voting roll."\n\nThe man smirked. "Are you Yakut?" he said. Aysen nodded. "My, my." He barked at the guard in Russian, who went to the backs of the office and summoned a paper form, composed of five to six sheets. "Fill this form and do the test. I will decide if you can vote."\n\nAysen spoke Russian, but not this kind of Russian. Scientific nomenclatures, technical terms, so many things he could not understand. The form was a literacy test, he realized. A way to cheat the Sakha people from their right to vote. Still, he filled the form with every ounce of knowledge in his mind and handed it to the man.\n\nAn affected disappointment. "I am sorry, but you can't. Perhaps once you've studied a bit more, you would be able to do so. However, as it stands, I can see nothing good coming out of you voting." A smile. "No offense." Aysen left the office fuming, but also frustrated."
 matkovsky.3.a:0 "The Party needs competent voters."
 
 matkovsky.4.t:0 "Status Report"
 matkovsky.4.desc:0 "A report was thrown on Matkovsky's desk from the State Intelligence Agency, spilling out sheets of paper and dossiers filled with printed reports and graphs. On its cover, it read 'THE SITUATION IN THE WEST' - gathered intelligence providing a comprehensive oversight of the warlords and bandit republics clashing in Central Siberia. The Vozhd gave the papers a long and skeptical stare, before reaching over and carefully flicking through each page.\n\nHe scoured over each sheet, examining the details of every bolshevik briggand and opportunist despot rampaging throughout the icy region. Like animals, they skirmished with each other for scraps of food and resources in the frozen plains to the west. Finally, the Vozhd came to a page detailing various strategic and logistical plans for a possible annexation and integration of the region, and his eyes began to glow.\n\nHis authoritarian ego nourished, Matkovsky smirked and tossed the document back on his wooden desk. He leaned back in his chair and reflected upon the proposal, exciting his senses with all kinds of plans to march westwards."
 matkovsky.4.a:0 "This is only the beginning."
 
 matkovsky.5.t:0 "In the Interests of National Security"
 matkovsky.5.desc:0 "The Vozhd, upon realising control over much of Eastern Siberia, has returned his attention to matters of state security. After all, in order to have a stable republic, he explains, it must be protected from within and without. Thus, it has been determined that the State Intelligence Agency is to have far greater autonomy from legal restrictions and the authority to conduct operations that will safeguard our nation against subversives and revolutionaries.\n\nDoors are kicked down, homes are raided, hundreds are arrested, and traitors are shot. In the name of national security, there can be no margin of error. The Vozhd cannot afford to let this young republic, this great hope for Russia, fall to seditious villainy from the dark corners of the eastern wastes. The siberian wilderness is unforgiving, and for the crime of treason, Matkovsky is too."
 matkovsky.5.a:0 "We will take no chances."
 
 matkovsky.6.t:0 "Fair Elections"
 matkovsky.6.desc:0 "There were three names on the ballot for the Tomsk-12 constituency. Two were the candidates of the Russian National Labor Party, who had all the support the Party could give them. Time in the local radio, campaigning funds, and the posters with their names that stuck on seemingly every window-corner of a Tomsk street. The Peace Preservation Act had mandated strict ideological requirements for political parties, effectively disqualifying any of the Tomsk Salons from running.\n\nThe other candidate was an independent, a former Bastillard. He entered the elections knowing full well that he was at a disadvantage. None of the old Salons could help him. Radios and newspapers refused to give him interviews. He had some discreet money funneled through by his old pals in the Bastillards, but that itself was a dangerous proposition. Should the authorities discover them, he would be charged with fraud and disqualified from the election. So he did what he did in his Bastillard days: standing on street-corners trying to insult people enough to pay attention to him. Some days, he could have a conversation. Others, the police hauled him away, naming him a "public pest."\n\nWhen the votes were tallied at the end of the day, the result was unsurprising. Ninety-five percent voted for the RNLP candidates, the rest going to the independent."
 matkovsky.6.a:0 "Without political cause, there can be no political resistance."
 
 matkovsky.7.t:0 "Volunteer Work"
 matkovsky.7.desc:0 "After the primaries, Alyosha spent his days milling about the town of Amur, doing odd-jobs and nothing in particular. He had spent a fortune to enter the Russian National Labor Party, only to be defeated in the primaries. Alyosha's politics were liberal: he had hoped to join the RNLP with the express purpose of reforming it from within. Now, bereft of money and opportunities, his days went by too slowly but also too quickly, like candles.\n\nIt didn't take too long for the SIA to find Alyosha. He was not a discreet man, and his behavior had attracted attention. Just as he entered a bar to drink his worries away, two men, one thin and tall, one stocky and beefy, tapped him on the shoulder. "Mr. Alyosha?" they said, "Could you please come with us? We are from the Party. We need to talk."\n\nAt first, Alyosha was hopeful. Maybe the Vozhd saw potential in him as a politician and had sent these two men to give him a second chance. However, his flights of fancy were brought down by the weight of gravity when he realized that these two men were probably from the SIA.\n\nTaking him to a quiet street corner, they interrogated Alyosha on his faith for the Russian people, before asking him to volunteer in the Dalstroy. His face paled, but he had little choice. "Yes," he said. "Yes.""
 matkovsky.7.a:0 "If one cannot serve in the political arena, mayhaps one can serve as a laborer."
 
 matkovsky.8.t:0 "Concessions from the Vozhd"
 matkovsky.8.desc:0 ""Phoning-in this morning, we have received firm assurance from Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the Siberian National Republic, that efforts towards the strengthening of their free republic have recently undergone significant improvement. We have insisted in the past that if they want to hear anything from the United States, they too must show their dedication to the rights of men, to which they have appropriately adjusted and committed themselves to.\n\nMatkovsky presented evidence to suggest that the treatment of minority groups has improved from the Russian ruling establishment. Moreover, we are assured that liberties guaranteed in law have been respected by the state and law enforcement across the nation. Indeed, our own few diplomats across the Pacific have given us the thumbs up after being taken on a tour of Siberia by dozens of state officials to see the great potential of the region, not giving us a single tip for anything worthy of criticism in the young republic.\n\nMatkosvky was slow in his replies when we questioned him, but we have faith he will follow through on his promises. Until then, we will continue our diplomatic missions to discover more about the mysterious eastern republic now cozying up to us."

 matkovsky.9.desc:0 """AND HALT!"\n\nThe ranks of Siberian Rangers stopped their march, and a great crash echoed throughout the encampment as the soldiers stamped their boots. They stood in regimented columns, upright in rows and awaiting Captain Oleg's next command. These were the new recruits and they had been undergoing viscous training in the wilderness of Siberia to acclimatize them to the bitter eastern chill. Training was harsh, and the officers harsher, but such strict order could carve these men into warriors worthy of the Vozhd's command.\n\nResisting the harsh Siberian cold, they stood still as Captain Oleg walked past and examined each recruit. He looked at each one of the men in the eye and studied their posture. His gaze was piercing and intimidating, his very stare disciplining any sense of disloyalty in the young men's hearts. Captain Oleg reached the end of the column, to which he raised his hand for a moment and the recruits lifted their rifles to their side in synchrony. With his back turned to the recruits, the collective clatter of the rifles reminded Captain Oleg of his early days in the military, and he gazed back at the men to notice they were far more skilled than he was. He smiled beneath his bushy mustache and chuckled for a moment, before returning to his cold and unforgiving gaze."

 matkovsky.10.desc:0 "Matkovsky sat in his office, drinking wine. Finally, after all these years, a vintage worth its legacy. Warm, sweet, it made Matkovsky tipsy and slightly drunk. The gramophone from Harbin sat in the corner of the room, blaring nostalgic songs: patriotic marches, anthems, Tchaikovsky. The sweet tunes and melodies of his youth brought back memories of him as a teenage boy in the Paris of the East. Finally, all that suffering, all that pain, was worth it.\n\nA knocking on the door, a disturbance to the rhythm. His doctor came through the door, lathered in an icy sweat. His glasses seemed to tremble as he walked forward, his eyes averted from Matkovsky's face. "S-sir," he said, stammering, fear apparent in the crashing of his teeth, "I-I bring you bad news."\n\nLeanig back on his grandiose chair, Matkovsky spoke. "What kind of bad news, doctor? Can't you see that the Vozhd is having a good time? Can't it wait? Surely you do not dare risk my wrath."\n\n"N-no, sir. It absolutely cannot." Swallowing, he continued. "I am afraid you are afflicted with cancer, sir."\n\nFor a moment Matkovsky sat still. He could not believe what had traveled through the doctor's lips. Cancer? Him? At the peak of his life, at this very moment? Lies! Lies! He stood up, calmly, wine glass in hand. Matkovsky jerked his arm back and forward again, catapulting the glass into the doctor's suit, splattering him in red. He wanted to shout, to scream, but he had to be calm.\n\n"Guards! Guards! Take this man away from me!" Boots trampled into the room. "Volunteer him for Dalstroy work. Make sure he is thoroughly educated. Understand?" Nods. "Dismissed." They carried the doctor out, and sobbing trailed after their departure."
