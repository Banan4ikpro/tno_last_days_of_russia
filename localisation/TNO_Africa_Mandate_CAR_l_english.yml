 POLITICS_WILLIAM_WESTMORELAND_CAR_DESC:0 "The African continent is a complex place, filled with diverse groups of people, all under the supervision of General William Westmoreland. Initially called upon to halt the Schild offensive in South Africa, Westmoreland has been called in for an even more daunting task. Much like the initial deployment to South Africa, the American occupation of the continent was hasty and unplanned. The hero of Cape Town has been called upon once again to put out the raging inferno in the heart of Africa.\n\nYet this time, Westmoreland faces even longer odds and a far worse situation on the ground. The sheer disorganization of the military regime is trouble enough, as newly placed administrators struggle with finding enough translators, keeping supply lines open, and keeping up a good face for the public. Shackled by a convoluted bureaucracy and no time to organize it, Westmoreland is finding it increasingly difficult to justify the American presence in Africa to Congress back home. Bearing the weight of a whole continent on his shoulders, Westmoreland will struggle to get his men out of Africa without making serious concessions to American interests or, more likely, the long term stability of the region."
